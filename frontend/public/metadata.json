Their piece connects to my desire to understand how to do good work at a personal level. During my career, I have noticed how much the environment that I am in impacts the quality of my work . In technology companies, there is generally some energy devoted to improving the environments we work in. People talk about meeting schedules, creating opportunities for deep work and optimizing how often teams plan. Nielsen and Qiu take an even higher level view than that. They explore how societal structures create incentives which impact output in knowledge work environments.  They are not thinking about the output of one person, or one company, or one sector, but how to create societal wide structures for improving the way we generate knowledge.\n\nNielsen and Qiu\u2019s strategy to persuade the reader that we should spend more energy exploring alternative structures is to show many examples of new structures which might have different outcomes. I find this app0roach to be quite persuasive because it is grounded in concrete suggestions. It is easy to get excited about exploring the large design space they present of possible structures. By showing how large this space is, and how under explored it is they motivate the importance of creating an ecosystem that helps us explore. \n","\n\nTo explore this space of scientific structures we first need to understand how our current scientific structures are performing today. This understanding will help us make sense of what is happening when we explore a new structure. Nielsen and Qiu explain that this exploration requires the ability to create  **decisive results**.  A decisive result is a finding that is  *\u201cstrong enough to drive real change\u201c*. Being able to collect this type of evidence is important because it can *\u201cconvince you of things you regard as a priori unlikely or distasteful\u201c*.  \n\n**Decisive Results** are critical because there are currently conflicting opinions about what scientific systems work best. Current discussions about what works best are mostly grounded in rhetoric since it is difficult to evaluate outcomes and test new directions.  The ability to generate **decisive results** would move our discussions from purely theoretical to grounded in experimentation. We could learn which structures outperform others and even those who did not initially like a new structure would have to agree that it is beneficial. If our results are not strong enough to convince those who have different opinions, then it will be difficult to make system wide progress.\n\nCreating an ecosystem where decisive results are regularly obtained will require these three abilities:  \n1. The ability to try a new system \/ structure.\n2. The ability to collect evidence about how this new structure is working\n3. A method for comparing the evidence collected in step 2 with baseline measures of effectiveness.\n\nWhile the process of creating a **decisive result** moves from step 1 to step 3, I am going to discuss them in the opposite direction.\n","\n\nTo evaluate a new scientific structure we need information about how other programs perform that we can compare it with. Without a comparison point, knowing that a scientific program creates a breakthrough finding every three years does not help us. If other programs only make one breakthrough every ten years though, we can understand that our new program represents a performance improvement and we should look into expanding it.\n\nAn important starting point for meta science is to evaluate how existing research programs are performing. In Nielsen and Qiu\u2019s piece they mention the [Shanghai Rankings](https:\/\/www.shanghairanking.com\/) as one way to evaluate the quality of a research university. We need other measures that look at many different scientific programs. We should develop many different metrics that are trying to evaluate research programs in different perspectives. It will be important that these metrics look at different levels of granularity as well. Rather than only focusing on the entire university, we could look at departments, labs or even individual researchers. Doing many experiments trying to measure scientific endeavors will help us both understand what is currently working today, but also improve our measurement ability going forward. \n\nTo avoid the key difficulty of evaluating researching programs when **outcomes are not clear until far in the future**, I would start by working on evaluating the success of historical programs. Nielsen and Qiu propose such an idea when they suggest using the history of science as a basis for program evaluation. Using historical programs is an easier starting point because the passing of time provides clarity by showing us which work gets extended the most. The most influential works are the ones that open up many new lines of discovery. In the present it is difficult to know which results are going to be continually built on.\n\nTo push forward this measurement project I would give out mini grants for people to try evaluating programs in different ways. The application would have the person specify a few different similar programs they want to measure and a few ideas for different approaches to measure those programs. This mini grant program would hopeful generate a diverse set of ideas about how to evaluate programs. The results from all the studies could also generate some initial baseline measures of effectiveness. Before running experiments with new structures, it seems important to use existing data to generate better evaluation techniques.\n","\nThis historical approach could generate initial baselines and some new measurement instruments, but it will not generalize to measurement on a smaller time scale. While making improvements over a long time scale is important, the quicker we can get high quality feedback on program effectiveness the more transformative a meta science ecosystem will be.\n\nA current common approach to evaluating the effectiveness of research is by asking experts in the field for their opinion. While this approach is not terrible, Nielsen and Qiu raise concerns that it can lead to a lot of centralization. Experts are more likely to rate work highly which is similar to their own work. An important part of their vision for metascience is that riskier work and people who are outsiders should be able to have success. Using experts opinion to evaluate research will probably not lead to the diversity and decentralization that Nielsen and Qiu believe is critical. \n\nWe can take lessons about how to design a metascience ecosystem where there is both decentralization and diversity in the surfacing of work from another system, Tiktok. On Tiktok, any video from any creator can rise to the top. People with no prior success or fan bases are consistently able to create videos that outperform those who have had a lot of success in the past. Tiktok is able to achieve this, by crowd sourcing which content is good. An approach that is similar to asking a panel of experts might be what HBO or the movie industry do. While that more centralized approach can be successful Tiktok is a perfect example of how leaning into diversity and decentralization can create all sorts of new outcomes that were previously missed.\n\nTikTok\u2019s approach of using the entire population to evaluate the quality of content might not be a perfect fit for evaluating research outcomes though. Everyone on Tiktok is relatively equally able to identify if a video is entertaining. It is a much more difficult task to understand how likely it is that a research project is important. One medium between these two approaches might be to use [prediction markets](https:\/\/astralcodexten.substack.com\/p\/prediction-market-faq?publication_id=89120&post_id=91718311&isFreemail=false).  Prediction markets can be used to evaluate which programs will be the most influential. This would work by creating a prediction market where individuals would bet on how important a piece of research will be in ten years from now. Anyone will have the ability to place a monetary bet based on how confident they are about that outcome. In the long run these prediction markets should in aggregate predict which research outcomes will be the most influential. Using prediction markets has the added benefit of creating a monetary incentive for those who are good at evaluating how important research is.\n\nActually implementing prediction markets for evaluating research is a complex process, that will involve careful design. It is important that the markets resolve on a quick enough time scale that people are incentivized to participate in them. It is also possible that the research which is most influential in ten years will be different than the research that is most influential in twenty years. For prediction markets to work well it will be important to design the markets so they create the right incentives. Prediction markets  seem like they could be a powerful way to remove some of the centralization that currently exists in evaluating research.\n\nIf using a mini grant program allows us to generate baseline measures of effectiveness and prediction markets helps us evaluate new research programs than we might be able to generate decisive results. The last step is the ability to try new programs. This part is mostly reliant on having money. If there is money to fund new programs we now have the tools to evaluate that program.\n","\nOnce we can generate **decisive results** there are still open questions about how to use those results to update our scientific ecosystem.  Nielsen and Qiu refer to one aspect of this as the *unbounded growth problem*. Imagine we have tested a new program finding it to be more effective than all other programs. It is still not clear what we should do with this evidence. Should we destroy all other programs and make this the only scientific program that exists? How much funding should we devote to this program? Does our measurement of the effectiveness of the program also apply when the program is larger?\n\nSimilar to how we took inspiration from Tiktok above, we could learn lessons about how to update our scientific ecosystem from ecosystems in nature. In nature, an ecosystem has many different creatures coexisting at the same time. Each creature is dependent on the existence of other creatures for its survival. An animal needs  fruit for sustenance, and the fruit needs the animal to spread its seeds. If a creature\u2019s population becomes too large, it hurts other creatures in turn hurting itself. We could aim to develop a scientific ecosystem that has similar properties. In this comparison each scientific program is a creature in our ecosystem. We want a system where the success of programs is also dependent on the success of other programs. If one program gets too big this will hurt the other programs which will in turn hurt itself. \n\nWe need to combine this balancing property with making our ecosystem responsive to feedback.  If we introduce a new program into our ecosystem which is effective, we want it to grow. This requires a mechanism which gives programs that are successful the ability to grow. One area that is good at growing in response to success is revenue generating companies. When a company creates a product that is successful, it generates revenue which it re-invests into growth. This makes revenue generating companies incredibly responsive to feedback.\n\nIn our scientific ecosystem, we want to achieve the following two properties.\n1. Programs successes are somewhat connected to each other so that no one program becomes too large\n2. Programs are responsive tp feedback meaning programs that do well grow larger and programs that are unsuccessful die out\n\nWe might be able to achieve this by creating a web of research programs which is supported by revenue generating products. For this to work, we need to develop a system which appropriately passes revenue back up the value chain to the different programs. For each product there will hopefully be a number of different research programs which created the necessary insights for that product to succeed. Revenue will be given to these research programs in accordance with how much value they deliver to the product. This returning of revenue will help the ones that are generating lots of value grow large. Bringing a product to market will be dependent on multiple different programs serving different roles and so no one program should get too large, because it is dependent on the success of other programs for revenue.\n\nIn this proposed set up, the ultimate determinant of success is if the research contributes to a revenue generating product. I am sure this is problematic in that not all research that we want to happen will lend itself naturally to a product. That means this should be only one ecosystem among many. One difficulty of this eco system though might be that certain research will only lead to products on a very long time scale. These programs that are working on a longer time scale might grow less than programs which contribute to more immediate products. We could counter act this immediacy incentive by including our prediction market idea from earlier. Some of the money from the revenue generating products gets put aside and given to programs which are rated the highest in the prediction market outcomes.\n\nA key to creating an ecosystem that uses revenue generating products to regulate the size of research programs will be creating new tools to help with attributing how much of a product\u2019s success came from each research program. \n\n"],"filename":"response_to_vision_of_metascience"},{"created":1674036708983,"modified":1674572894953,"title":"My tooling - Eka","status":"In Progress","tags":["eka"],"blocks":[],"blocks_text":[],"filename":"my_tooling_-_eka"},{"created":1669047795530,"modified":1676026843014,"title":"Non book Reading Inbox","status":"In Progress","tags":["eka"],"blocks":[],"blocks_text":[],"filename":"non_book_reading_inbox"},{"created":1666957986749,"modified":1676026967025,"title":"How I want to structure my week","status":"In Progress","tags":["whoami"],"blocks":[],"blocks_text":["\nAnother really important aspect though is being fine when my days do not go to this exact structure.

I live in the same location with the same job. In previous years my yearly reflection involved thoughts on a big life change which caused a material shift in my conditions. A big life change once a year felt like a good cadence since I was making an effort to do lots of exploration after graduating from college. I worked at a number of different jobs, lived in different places and took on slightly different lifestyles. These experiences helped me understand what is important to me and how I want to spend my time. Instead of embarking on a new exploration, this past year has been a continuation of trends that I was already thinking about. Looking forward, I am eager to continue deepening existing threads.\n","\n\nA lot of my explorations the past few years have been centered on finding meaning outside of work. At the beginning of my career I tied a lot of my identity to who I was in a work context. There were times where my work dwarfed everything else in my life besides my relationship with Jenny. Over the past couple of years I have been working towards maintaining the meaning I derive from work, while not letting the amount of headspace work takes up become unhealthy.  I began this process in my [2020 in review](\/2020_in_review), mostly looking for ways to find distance from work. In my [2021 in Review](\/2021_in_review) I narrowed in on the importance of social communities outside of work.\n\nI have learned this year that having a diversity of communities where I find meaning helps me be balanced and healthy by extending my identity. I will have an unbalanced relationship with work, if I connect my sense of worth too directly with it. A healthier relationship is to recognize that my career helps me achieve meaning in some ways, but it is also only one aspect of who I am. While my relationships with family and friends have always been a way to stay balanced, I have gained a lot of value from some additional communities with structure. The book club that I have been in for the past couple years has really blossomed into a sustained community that allows my identity to be grounded in a different context.  Similarly, my meditation group values me for different reasons than my work place. In this piece I am going to touch on two other communities that I joined in the past year which helped keep me balanced. \n","\n\nAfter moving to Boston, I was excited to do some volunteering in my local setting. My work place is still centered in the Bay Area so volunteering is an opportunity to spend time connected to my local surroundings. I was also attracted to volunteering because from my previous experiences volunteering often means being in a setting that is quite different from my usual experience. Volunteering this past year, gave me exposure to environments and individuals who I do not frequently encounter in my day to day.\n\nIn 2022 I volunteered in two different settings:\n- I was a math tutor once a week for a sixth grade student through [Boston Partners in Education](https:\/\/bostonpartners.org\/) at Jackson\/Mann School\n- Over the summer, I tutored once a week for a class at a youth detention center in South Boston through the [Petey Greene Program](https:\/\/www.peteygreene.org\/).\n\nWhile both of these opportunities were tutoring programs most of my role was not about helping a student learn an academic subject. The difficulties these students face are generally not related to their ability to learn. When they were in the correct conditions, they all showed a remarkable ability to understand new material. For most of these students, it was difficult to create the necessary conditions to focus on learning something new. They were in chaotic environments, with many distractions and background worries. Being a good tutor was not about presenting the material in a new way, but being a consistent presence in their lives who would show up, be kind and believe in the students. \n\nA few more short reflections from my interactions with students this year:\n- It seems like students value interacting with individuals that are not present in their everyday environment.  I was an adult figure who did not have any preconceived notions about who the student was. When they met me they had a clean slate and the opportunity to build their identity anew.   \n- 1-1 interactions are really powerful. Since I could devote my full attention to one student at a time, I often was able to understand each learner in some depth. The adults who interact with the students everyday have to divide their attention across many different students at the same time. Because I was able to focus on just one student,  I often had a better understanding of where the student was struggling than the teacher did.\n- The activities we force kids to do are often so rote and mind numbing. Success in traditional schooling is often about the ability to do something tedious. \n- Our current society asks too much from a small segment of the population in helping children develop. So much is asked of teachers and parents. The amount of work they have to do is so overwhelming. Volunteering in a class room is a real help.\n\nVolunteering in these settings once a week was a grounding experience for me. It forced me to travel to parts of Boston I would not otherwise see. Before each session I had to put aside everything going on in my life so that I could be fully present with the students. It felt good that I could connect with the students I was tutoring and support them in some small way. This type of volunteering felt meaningful because I was able to concretely help a community with my presence. The students seemed to enjoy me coming every week and my presence help take some of the burden of the teachers.  \n","\nAfter two years off from frisbee, Jenny and I played the club frisbee season this year. Coming into the season I was conflicted about my relationship with frisbee. Similarly to how my career can take over my life, frisbee has previously taken over my life. I have directly connected my sense of self worth to how I was playing which was unhealthy. Frisbee was also a place where I was constantly comparing myself to others and overly concerned with how others perceived me.  \n\nWhile I still definitely had some struggles this year, in a lot of ways I was able to positively transform my relationship with frisbee. From tryouts through the beginning of the season I was still quite concerned with how others perceived me. Since I was playing frisbee with completely new people, I felt like every playing opportunity was a referendum on who I was on the field. This worry impacted me negatively both on and off the field. When I made a mistake I could spiral a little bit mentally because I thought other people would trust me less. It was also harder to connect with other players because I was worried about their perceptions of me. As the season went on, I learned to identify what playing well feels like in my body and mind. Developing this somatic sense for playing well has the added benefit of helping me understand how to reach that level of performance. This improved ability to evaluate my own play means I am less worried about others perception of my play. I know when I am playing well and when I am not performing as well. Playing frisbee is now less riddled with anxiety about how I am going to perform or how I compare to others. I am able to focus on my excitement to connect with others and to push myself.\n\nAfter the season, I have been reflecting on how much time Frisbee can take up in my life. There are so many ways that I could be spending my time, that it can feel quite costly putting so much of it towards frisbee. For now, I feel like playing a few more seasons and putting more time into becoming a better player is worth it. Frisbee is a microcosm where I can practice being the person that I want to be. Playing a competitive team sport naturally brings out a lot of emotional difficulties. The intensity of these challenges are not as apparent in many of the other environments I am in. While difficult at times, frisbee has been an important source of growth for me. \n\nLooking forward, there are still some challenges I face with frisbee that I am excited to work through. At a personal level, I have yet to become the frisbee player that I know I can be. I have seen glimpses of what it looks like when I am able to put all my skills together, but I am not consistent. Figuring out how to get better at something that I have already put so much time into is a very different task than learning the basics of something new. I am excited to keep figuring out the most meaningful ways to push my game forward. At a communal level, I have never been on a team that feels healthy and supportive for all members. Every team I have been on has brought many different people together to work towards a common goal. This had led to a deep connections. But they have also generally failed to make everyone feel included, to resolve difference and to build mental resilience to difficult circumstances. I am excited about contributing to building a team where everyone feels valued, accepted and motivated together while also supporting us in our differences.\n\nThrough my experiences this past year I have learned the importance of dividing my time, identity, and sense of meaning across a few different communities. Each community values something different in me allowing me to take on different roles. I can be more active in one community at one time and less active at other times. Diversity in my communities has helped increase my overall sense of balance.\n","\n\nBefore looking forward to next year, I want to briefly reflect on my goals for 2022. Looking back, I feel proud of how I spent my time with regards to my goals. I successfully got my drivers license which I thought there was a real chance might never happen! I did the most writing I have done in a year this past year, creating some pieces I am really proud of. With some fits and starts, I have cultivated a spaced repetition practice which has been quite helpful in learning new material. I have also done a ton of work this past year figuring out where I want to go next in my career.\n\nTowards the end of 2022 it has felt like I am hitting a nice groove. I am structuring my days so I spend a lot of time doing what is important to me and that I have a ton of energy. I would also attribute a lot of the success of this past year to the progress in my meditation practice ([Meditation in the year of 2022](\/meditation_in_the_year_of_2022)).\n","\n\nAs I have been working on this piece my thinking about goals has changed a bit. I enjoy the practice of making goals because I find them to be motivating and inspiring. The process of creating goals forces me to reflect on what is important to me and how I want to spend my time. Goals also enable me to be forward facing imagining a point in time where I have accomplished something I am proud of. But, as I have been reflecting, I have also noticed how goals can cause guilt or disappointment. Even though I am incredibly proud of the writing I did in the past year, there is some sense of disappointment from not producing a piece of writing every week like I initially intended. It seems like the danger in goals comes from trying to do too much at once. We are only able to accomplish tasks at a shorter timescale and often our situations change. \n\nIn order to accomplish a goal, I have found it helpful to connect that goal to a consistent behavior such as a weekly or daily habit. Once I have identified the habit, I can narrow my focus. I do not have to worry about doing so much, but can instead focus on what I have to do that week or day. In some ways the goal is no longer important even.  If I am able to consistently do the habit, but not meet the goal, then there was most likely something problematic about the goal. On a day to day basis I will have spent my time in the way that I want to and that is all that I can do. \n\nIt feels important to have both the long term thinking of goals and the short term thinking of habits. The long term thinking allows me to take a broader perspective of everything I could be doing to identify what feels important. The shorter term thinking helps me make day to day decisions. For this year, I am going to name a few goals and then habits connected to them. We will see how this new process works out! I am open to the idea that my longer term thinking should take a different format than goals but this seems like a good place for now. \n\nOne quick thought on habits: For any habit to stick, it is important that I enjoy it. It is difficult to force myself to have an unpleasant experience regularly. With habits like exercising or meditation, once I found a way to make the activity itself enjoyable, then it became easy to stick to the habit. \n\n**Habits to continue**\n- Starting my day off with some sort of short movement (stretching, foam rolling, yoga) followed by meditation practice.\n- Setting aside time 2-3 times a week to do spaced repetition practice directly after lunch\n- Working out for Frisbee 3 times a week (2 lifts and 1 field workout during the offseason) and playing once a week\n\n**Goals \/ Habits that are new for 2023**\n- Build my own writing tool \/  one day each week I work on this project.

I was looking for a way to express myself. I had ideas swirling around in my head but no where to put them. I wanted to write more and also publish my ideas. I was drawn to the idea of starting a blog. I began writing some posts on Medium and explored different structures with my partner Jenny. Here is  [our first post](https:\/\/medium.com\/the-fox-and-the-hedgehog\/why-blog-11a7a0c166ef)  written in 2018 right after we graduated college explaining why we wanted to blog. We proceeded to  [publish a few more posts](https:\/\/medium.com\/the-fox-and-the-hedgehog)  exploring what was on our minds the summer after we graduated. One early theme you can see in these pieces is that we gravitated toward writing about other content we were interacting with. Often the impetus for a piece would be a book that we were reading or a few articles that we had read.\n\nAs we both became busier with full time jobs this blog floated into the background. It became difficult to put together pieces and we mostly stopped writing. It felt like pieces had to be polished and there was a fair amount of friction to even getting started. We had to write using Medium\u2019s tools and on their website. Writing is a really difficult task and any small fractions can be the difference between writing and just letting ideas float away.\nA  [large part of my learning process](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/internet_reading)  is reading from other writers on the internet. I admired people who had their own website and would publish frequently. Websites helped develop writers unique styles and build their voices. Simultaneously I started reading academic papers again. I had notes about each paper but they were just being stored locally on my laptop. A website seemed like a nice way to get myself writing again more. I studied computer science, I should be able to create my own website.\n\n","\nCreating my own website connected a lot of different threads. I was withdrawing from social media, deleting all of my accounts and wanting more ownership of my online presence. I also wanted an opportunity to showcase more than just my resume. Applying for jobs is a really difficult process and I felt like any resume could only present a narrow view of who I am. A website provides resources to learn more about me in a deeper way.\nThrough all of my reading I was accumulating a lot of knowledge but was lacking the ability to retain that knowledge or refer back to it. I would read things and then later not be able to find them again. Building a website also seemed like a way to help me retain all of the things I was reading. Both because I would have a written record that I could refer to, but also because it would force me to spend more time writing about what I was reading.\n\nThe first iteration of my website was built using  [Wordpress](https:\/\/wordpress.com\/) . Using Wordpress was a short lived and failed experiment. I had difficulty learning Wordpress\u2019s tools and it felt like there was even more lock in then on Medium. I was constrained by what Wordpress provided and also had to do all of my writing in their tools. After a couple of months I decided to look into static site generators. I found  [Hugo](https:\/\/gohugo.io\/)  and switched my site over in about a day using  [Netlify](https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/)  to handle deployment. One of the nicest things about Hugo is all the  [themes](https:\/\/themes.gohugo.io\/)  that have been developed. Themes make it so easy to create something that looks nice quickly. I used the  [Minimal](https:\/\/themes.gohugo.io\/theme\/minimal\/)  theme and was so much happier about using Hugo rather than Wordpress.\nOne of the downsides of Hugo being so easy to get started with, was that I never really understood the tooling I was using. Each time I wanted to make a change to my website, I was mostly stumbling around trying out different things until something worked. I did not have a strong grasp over CSS and lacked an understanding of how the website was actually wired together. While Hugo was a a good starting place, I found it difficult to make changes, and when I did, not really understanding why they were working.\n\nThere was no real reason for me to leave Hugo though. I had no experience doing front-end development and almost all of the my needs were being met. After reading this  [piece about Machine Learning research](http:\/\/joschu.net\/blog\/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)  I started keeping a work journal. The first iteration of this work journal was just a different google doc for each month and a new page for each day. While the process of keeping this journal was helpful, I rarely referred back to it. I was allured by the promise of switching my work journal over to  [Roam Research](https:\/\/roamresearch.com\/) . Roam is a tool that is being built for what I wanted to do and Roam promised to make my journaling more accessible. I started taking all of my notes in Roam. Roam was absolutely a better solution but it still presented its own series of problems. My notes had to follow Roam\u2019s bullet point format and all of my notes had to exist in two places, both on Roam and on my website. I would take notes on Roam and then if I wanted to make a post on my website I had to reformat the note and move it into my text editor\nI started thinking about building tooling that allowed me to do everything I wanted in one my place. I want a very low barrier to taking notes. I want all of my notes \/ posts to be searchable and connected. I want to then publish them to my website with minimal lift. I want easily extend my website, add new functionality and change how it looks. As I was expressing these ideas to my friend, he told me to read this  [article](https:\/\/erikwinter.nl\/articles\/2020\/why-i-built-my-own-shitty-static-site-generator\/) . I connected with a lot of the frustrations expressed in that post.\n\nThat post illuminated how our tools impact the way we think. I already knew this to some extent. I have spent a lot of time figuring out my coding set up and optimizing it to improve how I work. But really, my note taking tool and knowledge repository is my most important tool. It is the tool I use the most often and one I am going to use for my entire career. The tool is only going to grow in importance and value the more I use it. It absolutely makes sense for me to optimize this tool for my own use cases.\n\n","\nI decided to build my own website and note taking tool from scratch. I have currently only finished the website part and am still working on the note taking part of it. Building the tool from scratch forced me to learn a lot that I would not have otherwise. I have a much better understanding of CSS and how it interacts with HTML. I learned VueJS and can now build websites or make changes to websites much quicker. When I want to add something to this website it often can be measured in minutes of time rather than days now.\nSo what is this project? I think it can most aptly be described as my personal  [archive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Archival_science) . This website is both the actual archive itself and the tool that helps me create and maintain my archive.\nFor those interested here is more information about the technical stack of this tool:\n\n* I built the front end using  [Vue](https:\/\/vuejs.org\/) . I picked Vue because it seemed the easiest framework to pick up having not frontend experience.\n* The backend is built using  [Python](https:\/\/www.python.org\/) ,  [Docker](https:\/\/www.docker.com\/)  and  [FastAPI](https:\/\/fastapi.tiangolo.com\/) . These are all tools I have used extensively and know very well. The best part about building this tool myself is that I can use Python to do all the backend.\n* I use the javascript library  [Showdown](https:\/\/github.com\/showdownjs\/showdown)  to parse markdown.\n* I developed my own version of sidenotes based on some code from  [Tufte-CSS](https:\/\/github.com\/edwardtufte\/tufte-css) \n* I use  [Coolors](https:\/\/coolors.co\/)  to create the color scheme.\n* I use  [Goat Counter](https:\/\/www.goatcounter.com\/)  to monitor website usage\n* I use  [Vercel](https:\/\/github.com\/vercel\/vercel)  to handle deployment of the frontend and backend\n"],"filename":"personal_archive_project"},{"created":1675946488663,"modified":1676301603693,"title":"Impact and Proximity","status":"Finished","tags":["career_decisions"],"blocks":["The role of a career"],"blocks_text":["\nI was first faced with ambiguity about the macro direction of my life sophomore year of college. Until then, there was a straightforward path set out for me. I would go through my years of education and then attend the best college that wanted me. There was nothing decided about what I would do after college though. During my sophomore year I had to plan out what my summer would look like. I got an internship which gave a glimpse of what life after graduating could look like.  \n\nBefore that internship when I envisioned my life after college, I used my parents as role models. Their lives were the adult lives that I was most familiar with. It was easy to use their experience as a jumping off point. The post schooling life felt completely different than what I had experienced so far. Picturing something I did not have experience with, I used my most known reference point to guide me. \n\nI pictured my career path in purely practical terms since that is the place both my parents have ended up. They each found their current jobs because they needed a stable source of income to support a family. Their jobs provide them with the means to do what they really care about; raise three boys. I assumed that my career would be similar to theirs. My job would not be something I was really passionate about. I would find meaning in my life through my friends and my family. My career would enabled me to do the other things that were what I found the most meaningful.\n\nThis framing of a job as purely functional changed after my sophomore summer. I worked an office job at a cyber security firm in Chicago. Each day was mind numbing. The office did not have much work for me so I had to find ways to pass the time, while still looking like I was working. I was spending forty hours a week being bored. I was just hoping time would pass me by. When I would get off work, I would not have energy but instead feel completely drained of life.\n\nSince that summer I have put a lot of thought into what I am doing for work. My job is the way I spend most of my waking hours. I want it to be something that is at least stimulating. Hopefully it is something that gives me energy rather than takes it away. I know that there will be some undesirable parts of every job, but that summer felt like a really bad place to be. I was just hoping time would pass as quickly as possible rather than enjoying what I was doing. Every night I would be unhappy faced with going back into the office the next day and doing the same thing. \n\nAfter that, I decided that I would put increased effort into finding a career path that at a minimum was stimulating. During my junior year the topic I was most interested in was [machine learning](\/posts\/week_4_interest_in_ml) and so I put effort into finding work that was related in any way. I spent part of that year and the summer doing ML research for a professor. This time showed me how engaging a job could be. I was excited to work everyday and that left me with even more energy when I left work. It was apparent to me how much better everything was when I was spending my time in a way that felt exciting. \n\n***\nDuring this transition from education to working, I received very little guidance about how to make career decisions. It was not even immediately clear how important of a decision it could be. Picking how I spend the majority of my time is one of the most important decisions I have to make. It is one of the most important decisions anyone has to make. I am lucky and extremely privileged that I have the opportunity to make this decision so strategically. There are so many people in the world who do not have that opportunity. Since I am privileged to have some say in what type of work I do, it is important that I make a decision that is thoughtful.\n\nWhen I make a decision that involves ambiguity and uncertainty, I look to reference points as signal about what I should do. Unfortunately with careers the most tangible reference point is [salary](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/diversity_in_funding_models). It is easy to fall into the mindset that a higher paying job is a more desirable one. The other reference point I use is seeing what people around me have done. Whether that is my parents, mentors or my peers, I will use others' decisions as guidance. While this can be helpful, it can also lead to bad decisions if others are different from you. It can also cause bad collective outcomes if everyone is basing their decision on each other.\n\nThe more career decisions I have made, the more I understand the importance of not relying on those reference points as much. This is not easy though, because those reference points are so strong. As I have gotten older it has become evident that part of the reason I studied computer science is because it is a field that others praise and there exists a well known financial payoff. But for me to find meaning and purpose in my work, I have to do the hard task of deeply investigating what is important to me. Hearing other's opinions can be helpful, but I probably rely on them too heavily rather than doing the hard internal work to know what is right for me.\n\nEach job is an opportunity to learn more about myself. Some things can only be learned through experience. I have changed jobs in the past because I learned more about what was important to me. I used those learnings to find a situation where I believed I would be happier. In brief the jumps I have made and what I learned:\n\nI left Nielsen after a year and three months for Change Research\n\t    - Working at a huge company is quite frustrating. There is an intense amount of bureaucracy meaning change happens so slowly.  I wanted to work at a smaller more nimble company. \n\t    - Measuring and improving advertising felt like I was actively causing harm. I was looking for work that felt like it was making a positive impact\n    \nI left Change Research for Whisper after a year and three months\n\t    - I never want to take for granted that what I am doing is beneficial. I should be constantly evaluating the impact of my work.\n\t    - The people you work with on a day to day basis will have the biggest impact on your happiness levels\n\t    - There are so many different problems that it could be stimulating to work on\n***\nI recently, hit the one year anniversary at Whisper and have been reflecting on what I have learned. At one year it feels like, most of the evidence I have collected so far has been confirmed. I am quite happy at Whisper. There are a few great people I work with who keep me happy on a day to day basis. My work centers on measuring hearing aid performance and using that understanding to deliver a better product.\n\nAfter leaving Nielsen, during both my job searches I tried to focus on the impact of the work I was doing. I would talk about how I wanted to be doing work that was impactful. At Change Research, it felt like I was at least theoretically doing the most impactful work I could be. I was helping democrats win elections at a critical junction. At Whisper, I am also doing theoretically impactful work. I am helping people experience better lives by improving their ability to interact with others. \n\nBut with both of these jobs, it still feels like there is something off with regards to impact. If impact is something that is important to me in my career, then I want a stronger understanding of what I am looking for. \n\nImpact is the way that our actions change the world. We are all constantly forming the world around us with our actions. Every action I take has an effect on someone else and their life. When I am nice to someone that impacts their emotional state. When I am frustrated or disgruntled that also impacts others. My job is a place where a lot of my actions take place. The impact of my works is how the actions I take at work change the world around me.\n\nImpact has both a magnitude and a direction. When we take an action the change it causes moves us from one state to another. This new state is different from the old state in some discernible way. It is not always clear what the direction or magnitude is, but we are moving from one place to another. Actions where the new state is further away from the current state have a larger magnitude. Knowing what actions to take depends on a clear picture of what state you want to move toward.\n\nWhile the above is not a perfect framework, we can start using it to help us think about impact. Our impact is made up of all the actions we take. Each action moves the world from one state to another state. Having a large impact means moving the state of the world a lot. Having a positive impact means  moving the world to a state that we believe is more desirable. We do not always know what the impact of our actions is. We can estimate the impact of our actions before taking them and measure the impact afterwards. \n\nMy perception of impact is influenced by how **proximate** I am to it (this idea of [proximate](https:\/\/www.tlu.edu\/news\/bryan-stevenson-get-proximate-on-issues-of-race-and-injustice) is taken from [Bryan Stevenson](https:\/\/onbeing.org\/programs\/bryan-stevenson-finding-the-courage-for-whats-redemptive\/) of [EJI](https:\/\/eji.org\/)). When I am a good partner to Jenny, that impact is incredibly close to me. I am impacting something that touches my day to day life. I definitively know that there is impact happening and can see what that impact causes. When I make a donation to [GiveDirectly](https:\/\/www.givedirectly.org\/) they give money to someone in need. That impact might be large but it is quite distant. I will probably never see the benefits of that donation and there is no way for me to evaluate that the money I donated was actually impactful. I am trusting GiveDirectly and others' (e.g. [Charity Navigator](charitynavigator.org)) evaluation of GiveDirectly. While this might be partly selfish, I feel more moved by impact that I am proximate to. I also have a much higher ability to understand what the impact is. \n***\nUsing the above understanding of impact we can return to how I think about the impact of my own career. It is important for my career to have a positive impact because I believe having a positive impact gives my actions meaning. An important aspect of my impact is my proximity to it. I find it more meaningful to be close to the impact my work is having.\n\nThe importance of being proximate has helped me understand the ways I struggle with the [80,000 hours project](https:\/\/80000hours.org\/). The 80,000 hours project is a part of the [effective altruism](https:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.org\/) movement. They have put a lot of thought into how to have an impactful career. Reading their resources has changed my own thinking and the people there are quite thoughtful. While I feel connected to their overall direction and mission, I felt a disconnect about the type of projects they suggest to work on. They suggest possible paths as [earning to give](https:\/\/www.effectivealtruism.org\/) or working on AGI alignment. While both of these paths might have a large positive impact, you will be quite far away from that impact. When you spend your time earning as much money as you can to donate it, the impact you are having is quite far from the way you spend your time. We are still so far away from AGI, that work on AI alignment is not proximate with our every day experiences. \n\nFor my own career, I want to be doing work that has a positive impact but also work that I am proximate to. Being proximate to the impact gives me a better understanding of the impact that I am having. Understanding that impact will help me be better at the work because I can recalibrate my actions as I learn more about what the impact actually is.\n\nTo find this type of work, I  need to focus on things I am already proximate to or become more proximate to things that will have a positive impact. I am really motivated to work on problems related to [creating novel organizations](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/a_different_funding_model) because I have so much first hand experience with how organizational structure impacts what is created. If I believe some type of work could be impactful, then it is important for me to become proximate to it. For example, When I donate money to charities, I mostly focus on giving to organizations that work in developing countries. Developing countries have many more people living in poverty. Improving living conditions for someone who has a more difficult life can often be a larger change. If I truly believe that I can have the largest impact by improving living conditions in developing countries, then it is important for me to become proximate to that issue by moving to a developing country.\n\nPart of the difficulty I am having with impact of my career might be related to being a software engineer. This does not have to be the case, but most software engineers are not proximate to the impact of their work. I spend my time coding and then someone quite distant from me is eventually impacted. Tech companies do try to understand their impact through data, but even that data leaves developers at quite a distance. They are not connected with the people who are being impacted. Understanding the importance of being proximate means that I should find ways at work to get closer to my impact. \n***\n\nThis reflection helps me understand what I mean by trying to find work that is impactful. I want to take actions that help move the world to a better state. I want to be proximate to the impact I am having because it allows me to actually see what that impact is. At my current job I should try to become more proximate to the impact of my work.\n\nIf I truly believe that the largest impact I can have is by improving living conditions in developing countries, then I should move to a developing country and find work there. Trying to do that type of work from a distance does not make sense.\n"],"filename":"impact_and_proximity"},{"created":1666792979792,"modified":1676301606547,"title":"Picking my next project","status":"Finished","tags":["glyph","career_decisions"],"blocks":["Building Depth","Our creative history and creative future","Wide vs Deep Spectrum","Novel vs Ease Tradeoff","Understanding My Influence ","Emotional resonance - Changing our relationship to software","Backcasting for Emotional Resonance"],"blocks_text":["\n\nAs I mentioned in my [2022 in Review](\/2022_in_review) my career decisions so far have been focused on exploration. I have worked at a few different companies each time in a slightly different role. I have done data science, software engineering and data engineering in advertising, public opinion and consumer hardware. Each experience helped me learn about the type of work environment I like. They also taught me a lot about what I disliked! In [Why Microcommons](\/why_microcommons) I explore the qualities I want my work container to have. That piece focused on how I want to work rather than what I work on.  In this piece I am going to delve into what I want the contents of my next project to be. \n\nI have found picking a particular domain for a project to be challenging because there are so many different areas that I could be interested in. None of my previous jobs were in areas that I found to be extremely attractive but there were dynamic and exciting problems in all of them. Since I have previously felt relatively domain agnostic I have spent more time thinking about how I want to work rather than what I want to work on. As I look forward to picking my own project to work on though, it is important I put some thought into picking a domain that I will be excited about for an extended period of time. \n\nPicking a domain that feels compelling to me is particularly important because I want to be working on this next project for a more extended period of time than a couple of years. Because I have only stayed at each previous job for two years or less, I have not built a ton of depth in any specific domain. Regularly switching to new domains helped me develop a wide range of skills and forced me to learn how to ramp up in a new space quickly. But now I am interested in trying to build depth in a domain that I find particularly compelling. I am excited about building depth in one domain because I believe that certain types of contributions require deep understanding that is only possible from exploring that domain extensively.\n\nIn particular, I am interested in a project that aims to make a contribution in an area that many individuals have previously worked on. For example, many people have spent their time working on the basics of physics or mathematics. In order to continue pushing those fields forward it is necessary to have extensive domain knowledge to work at the cutting edge. In the rest of this piece I outline my thinking about why building this depth is important for the project I am interested it.  \n","\nAs I have been thinking about my next project a core question I am pondering is **\u201cHow to understand any projects\u2019s impact?\u201c**. This question is not one with a definitive correct answer. There are many different lenses that could be used to understand how a project affects our lives. Nevertheless, trying to answer this question is essential because it enables us to compare potential projects. Our framework for answering this question can be used to help determine if one project is a better use of our time than another. \n\nOne possible answer that I am currently finding helpful is to measure a project\u2019s impact by **how it changes what other projects are subsequently worked on**. This framing is inspired by [Michael Nielsen\u2019s musing](https:\/\/scienceplusplus.org\/cusc\/index.html#fn19) about how important discoveries in physics are used in future work. When a truly impactful discovery is made, it has a drastic impact on which projects are pursued afterwards. The projects that are pursued afterward will use that work as a given and then extend it or use it in another work. \n\nTo formalize this idea, we can say that every project is a function of the ***creative history*** at its moment of origination. The creative history is a bundle of all projects that have preceded it.  Every project is only possible because of the projects that have come before it. For example, most software companies starting today are only possible because of the creation of cloud computing. Cloud computing gives teams the necessary computing resources to build software. We can understand the impact of cloud computing by how it has changed which subsequent projects are started. \n\nA project\u2019s impact is not only how it gets used in other projects but also how it influences or inspires derivative work. While cloud computing is a straightforward example of how a project might enable other projects, it might be illustrative to consider another project that is not directly used by other projects. While there are not a lot of projects that are using Uber as a core technology, Uber has enabled derivative projects in many ways. Post Uber, many projects have tried to apply a similar model of increasing the utilization of latent resources by creating a new market in other areas. Uber also made it more likely for future projects to focus on improving the transportation sector. People see that Uber was able to achieve success in the field of transportation and this makes them more likely to tackle projects in a similar space.  A project changes what future projects are possible not only by how it is used, but how the project inspires others.\n\nWhen considering potential projects we can imagine how they might change our  **creative future**. When I first started this piece I was trying to develop a framework based on characterizing certain projects as *infrastructure*. In my head, an infrastructure project is one that directly enables others to do more. Examples of infrastructure projects would be things like cloud computing, the printing press, video editors, coding languages. I was struggling though to define the characteristics of an infrastructure project. I was unable to article which projects where infrastructure projects and which ones were not. This is because all projects, even ones that are quite narrow and specific change what types of future projects might be started. \n","\nUsing this framework we can compare potential projects by how they might update our **creative future**.  I have found two different spectrums helpful for giving structure to how a project might influence future work.\n\n1. Updates to our creative future may apply to many projects or a small subset of projects (wide vs deep)\n\nSome projects will enable many different types of derivative projects and other projects will greatly accelerate a narrow set of projects. For example, let\u2019s compare the impact of a CRM like Hubspot with the creation of a productivity tool like Notion. Hubspot helps enable projects that involve managing relationships with many different entities. For projects of this nature, Hubspot makes relationship management and tracking a lot easier allowing the project to focus their energy in other ways. Notion on the other hand has the potential to help the broad category of projects that involve transferring knowledge between people. Thats basically every project out there!\n\nComparing Hubspot and Notion shows that there is a tradeoff between trying to have a deep impact vs a wide impact. While Hubspot is only applicable to a smaller set of projects, for these types of projects Hubspot is quite helpful.  Notion on the other hand can help almost any project out there, but it will move the needle much less for each of those projects. Notion helps with knowledge management and organization, but it is not directly facilitating any specific project. \n\nAnother way to frame this spectrum might be to think of it in terms of specificity to generality. Hubspot is able to have a large impact by crafting their solution to specific instances. They know exactly the use cases they are building for and do not have to worry about applying to other situations.  Notion on the other hand has to make a solution that generalizes across many different instances. This generalization requires finding a commonality across many different areas rather than being grounded in just a few specific examples.\n\n","\n2. Updates to our creative future may enable new projects or ease existing projects (novel vs ease)\n\nSome projects will enable projects that were not previously possible while others are more likely to make projects that are currently possible today easier. To understand this spectrum we can compare building a quantum computer with a project like [Arc](https:\/\/thebrowser.company\/) which is creating a new web browser. Building a quantum computer will enable projects that are currently impossible. Once a quantum computer is built we will be able to do all sorts of computation that is currently impossible. Arc on the other hand is not directly enabling  any new  projects. Instead by creating a better browsing experience it is making the internet easier to utilize.\n\nProjects in different places on this spectrum face different difficulties. Projects which are directly enabling novel projects are less grounded in existing use cases. It is less clear exactly how they are going to update our creative future because we have a worse sense of what derivative projects might look like. It is easier to wrap our heads around how making existing projects easier might impact our creativity. But these projects face the challenge of already having an alternative solution in place. While it is easier to understand how Arc might improve a current project, they have a larger burden of showing how they are better than what already exists. This can be quite difficult because there is a switching cost which can be compounded by network effects. It is often important that many people are using the same solution so to get many people to switch to something new requires quite a large improvement. Quantum computing on the other hand is enabling what was previously impossible so they do not have competition in the same way.\n\nWhile using this uni-dimensional spectrum as a framework is helpful, I want to briefly acknowledge that it is an oversimplification. Often by making existing projects easier, new types of projects become possible.  New projects might start happening because making something easier has increased the accessibility of this project. Now because more people are tackling a project and they have more time available projects will start taking a different form. While I think this spectrum is still helpful, it can be murky to place a project on it. \n \n","\nIn the previous sections I have talked through some frameworks we can use to asses what the potential impact of a project might be. These spectrums give us a starting point for comparing different projects. Before using this framework, it also feels important to bring a perspective focused on the individuals working on the project. Projects do not exist independent from the people who work on them. Each project is intrinsically tied to the people who are working on it. For any project it is important to understand who those people are. For my own projects, it is important to connect any project to my understanding of self.\n\nAt a personal level, I believe the best use of my time is to work on projects that might be undervalued by others who are similar to me. Truthfully, there are so many people out there that have similar skillsets and backgrounds to me. People who went to an \u201celite\u201c academic institution, have worked on tech projects and have built software related skillsets. While I am absolutely drawn to working on climate related problems or problems in artificial intelligence, there are already so many people working in those spaces. Adding my time to that group of people is less likely to be as meaningful as spending my time in a domain that others are not as actively working on. \n\nWe can combine my interest in working on a project that is not valued highly by others with the two spectrums from earlier, to help identify what type of projects might be undervalued by others. Without doing an extensive analysis of all projects out there, my gut is that projects tend to be more  deep than general and more focused on novel creation than easing existing creation. As I discussed earlier focusing on a more narrow space is often easier because you are grounded in specific use cases. What you build does not have to generalize as broadly. On the other spectrum, building something that is more novel feels like an easier sell since it does not have to directly compete with something that exists.  Intuitively, it feels like more projects are narrowly focused on delivering a novel capability than more broadly focused on improving an existing capability. \n\nIf I want to be working on a project that is undervalued by others, I should be thinking about projects that look to have quite a wide impact by improving an existing capability. \n","\nWhile using logical reasoning to help constrain the type of project I want to work is helpful, the most important part of actually picking a project is finding something that emotionally resonates. I want a project that gives me a spark. A project that will keep me excited and give me energy. Finding a project that emotionally resonants is a huge advantage. That emotional connection will keep me motivated even when difficulties arise as they do with all projects.\n\nThe project area that sparked emotional resonance for me is changing our relationship to software. This project jumped out when I was reading [Where Wizards Stay up Late](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B000FC0WP6).  As I was reading about some of the engineers who helped develop the internet, it was so stark how different their relationship with technology was with what I experience today. All the engineers were constantly updating and editing their technology to fit their own needs and use cases. If they had an idea about how to improve a certain piece of software, they would make that change. If others also liked the change that they made, they would use it as well. My relationship to software on the other hand is one where I lack control. I can pick between a few different choices, but all the software I use is created by someone else and made for an average user. This is the case even though I am a software engineer! I spend all my time working on creating software and yet I have minimal control over all the software that I use everyday.  I find it incredibly exciting to think about having a similar relationship to software that the engineers in the book had.\n\nA project that focuses on changing our relationship to software through an improved ability to create and edit software is a project that meets all of my criteria. There are so many different projects that are centered on building and using software. Improving our ability to create software is something that is quite broadly applicable too many potential derivative projects. It is also a project which is not centered on creating some novel capability. We already have the ability to do a lot of these things, but it is about making it easier and more accessible.\n","\nIn this piece I have walked through my process to determine what project I want to work on next. I started by developing a small framework to help compare projects with each other. I then combined that framework with my some of my own opinions to narrow in on which types of projects feel like the best fit. Lastly, I used emotional connection as a guiding way to find which project in particular called out to me. I want to end this piece with some thoughts on how I understand emotional resonance and a method that can help find emotional resonance.\n\nIn a previous piece I have discussed how I believe emotional resonance is connected to the things we are proximate to ([Impact and Proximity](\/impact_and_proximity)). We are more likely to feel connected to something that we experience every day of our lives. I feel strongly about improving our ability to create software because I spent most of my days working on creating software. I spend so much of time writing code and trying to building different tools. Not only that, but I spend a lot of time using software. I think a lot about the impacts that the tools I use have on me. This project of improving our ability to control the software we use will have a drastic impact on my day to day. This does not mean that every project I work on has to have a connection to my everyday experience. But often that is a good way to find emotional resonance. If you want to work on a project that is not connected to your day to day, it might be a good idea to find ways to become proximate to that topic.\n\nI have found one of the most effective tools for finding emotional resonance is to imagine potential futures where my project is outrageously successful. I think this process of envisioning a future world is not only helpful for finding emotional connection, but also a useful tool for working on a project. For this project of changing our relationship with software, I am envisioning a future where everyone create their own software. Each person has thought about their own needs and what environments they want to be. They have taken existing software and adjusted it to fit their own uses cases. Each piece of software is personalized to person that is using it. This shift also has made software creation dramatically more accessible for the population and created economic opportunity for many individuals. People who have remixed software in compelling ways have been able to profit from their work of creating a solution that works for them. For more examples of backcasting see the vignettes we wrote on the Microcommons website related to each project ([glyph](https:\/\/microcommons.framer.website\/glyph), [unilink](https:\/\/microcommons.framer.website\/unilink), [phenom](https:\/\/microcommons.framer.website\/phenom), [II ed](https:\/\/microcommons.framer.website\/iied))\n\nEvery project that we take on involves using our time and resources to have an impact on the world. Each project changes what other types of projects people work on. For my next project I am incredibly motivated about changing the relationship that we have to software. I can envision in a world where everyone plays a more active role in crafting their digital environment. For any project it can be helpful to envision what future world we want to create. That future world can be used as a consistent source of motivation and a guiding force when making decisions.\n"],"filename":"picking_my_next_project"},{"created":1673019325764,"modified":1676301609174,"title":"Writing Process","status":"Finished","tags":["writing"],"blocks":["How environment impacts behaviors"],"blocks_text":["\nWhen I travel to new places my energy level is always quite high. When I wake up in a different city, I want my day to start as soon as possible. I am pulled out of bed by all the exciting things that I want to do. This energy is not specific to activities in that place. I have more energy to work out, write or read. When I am at home, sometimes I have that same energy, but it can be hard to recreate. There is not the same sense of urgency or excitement. While I wish I could always achieve that same energy at home, it might be a little bit unrealistic.\n\nOur surroundings and stimuli have such an impact on our mental state. The difference in energy when I am traveling is only one example of this. Even really small changes can cause quite the difference. After I buy a new pair of running shoes, I am more likely to go on a run. When I have a nice kitchen and tools I am more motivated to cook. The environment that we are in can make all the difference in terms of what we do. \n\nThis impact of our environment on behavior extends to all parts of our experience. It directly impacts the thoughts we have and what actions we take. This is why some people say [you are the sum of the people you surround yourself with](https:\/\/blog.samaltman.com\/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short). This is why writing can actually force you to have different thoughts than if you are in a conversation. Using a tool like [Roam](https:\/\/roamresearch.com\/) which forces the usage of bullet points can actually change what you create. It is important to make intentional decisions about what our environment looks like and what tools we use because of how large their impact can be. \n\nPart of me is scared when I notice how much my thoughts and actions are determined by the external. Another part of me wants to use this to help accomplish certain tasks. I am scared because I want to be resilient to external factors. Even if I have bad tools, I want to still accomplish difficult tasks. I do not want to be so dependent on having the exact correct situation. Working to be more resilient is important. I also recognize the impact my environment can have. Making conscience choices about my environment feels especially important when I am trying to do something hard. \n\n***\nI not only want to improve my writing, but to understand how to regularly do something that I find hard. The type of writing that I am trying to do in this project is quite labor intensive for me. This endeavor is partly about learning how to create systems and practices that facilitate this difficult task. What I learn about how to make writing easier might apply to other tasks I struggle with. Part of the goal is also to become resilient so I am less dependent on having a perfect situation with no distractions.\n\nI spend a lot of time pondering how I can improve my ability to accomplish things that I value. Often these conversations center on how to improve my work life or to spend more time making progress on projects. Last fall I had a discussion with researcher [Andy Matuschuk](https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/) about my pain points in that process and how I want to get better. After that conversation I honed in on the idea of better [attention allocation](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/project_intro). The core idea of that post is that I want to direct my energy towards meaningful tasks that are important to me. While that idea still resonates with me, the scope is probably too large. \n\nThis project centers on how can I do one thing; generating novel insight \/ clarity of thought which I can share with others. Rather than determining how I allocate all of my energy, I am prioritizing some of my energy towards doing one thing which is difficult and important. Learning how to allocate my energy once, will also teach me lessons about how to do it in general. \n\nWithout some structure or goals it is difficult to evaluate how I am doing. Without stressors and deadlines it is hard to evaluate what makes a good system. The stress lets you see the weak points and where it can be improved. This project with weekly deadlines forces me to look at the writing process frequently and critically.\n\n***\nA necessary part of improving my writing process is understanding it better.  When I understand the different components it is easier to identify what impacts my ability to make progress.  Breaking down my writing process into a few different steps is a helpful abstraction: \n\n**Step 1: The Spark** The first step is when an idea is generated. This does not happen siting in front of my laptop when I am trying to write. It happens when I am doing other things. When I am talking to a friend, when I am in the shower, on a walk, meditating. \n\n**Step 2: Gathering Wood** Now that I have a spark, I want to build a fire. This step involves collecting other ideas that connect to the spark. What else have I been thinking about that relates to this initial idea. How can this one idea build into a more cohesive piece? \n\n**Step 3: Building the Log Cabin** Once all of the wood is gathered it needs to be arranged into a general structure. All the ideas are arranged into a coherent structure. This is when I outline the structure of the piece \n\n**Step 4: Light it up**  Now that we have an outline, it is time to fill in all the detail. Hopefully everything catches fire, but some parts might not. Filling in an outline with text feels very similar to the way a log cabin gets engulfed in flames\n\n**Step 5: Managing the fire** Most of the hard work is done but things still need to be adjusted occasionally to keep the fire burning. We need to make edits and revisions. Occasionally this will be more substantial and sometimes it will just be small movements.\n\nUsing the stages of the writing process it is easier to pinpoint where my own difficulties with writing arise.\n\n- Steps 1 and 2 are currently my favorite parts of the writing process. I have no shortage of ideas. It is fun to then look at those ideas and connect them with each other. If anything I generate at ideas at such a fast rate that it can be difficult to manage all of them.\n- Step 3 is a place where I struggle quite a bit. I often skip that step or only do a half hearted job at it. I especially struggle with it when the ideas are disorganized already.\n- How step 4 goes is dependent on step 3. When step 3 goes well then 4 is quite easy. When I skip 3 or do a bad job at outlining then 4 can be a real struggle. The other difficult part is that while I have represented it as a linear process, it is not always such. Sometimes as I am doing step 4, I should really stop and do more outlining. As I start doing all the filling in, a clearer picture about the structure also forms. \n\n***\nHaving a goal for what my writing process should look like is helpful. Once I know what the current state is and what I want to future state to be, it becomes a lot more actionable to improve my process.\n\nIn order to create good pieces, there are a few properties that I want my process to have\n- I want to be working on pieces over a long period of time. Good writing takes a long time. I rarely want the ideas for a piece to develop in only a week. I want pieces to be iterated on for extended periods. \n- Over that extended period I want to touch the pieces frequently. When I am touching them frequently I will be thinking about them even when I am not at my desk writing. This type of thinking often leads to the best insights.\n- When the structure of a piece is good, finishing it up and filling it out is easy. When the structure is wrong, it is almost impossible. I want a process that helps me find the right structures. It should be flexible so I can switch to different structures easily when I find something is not working\n- When the space of possible things I could be working on is really large I gravitate to working on the easiest and most defined task. It can be helpful to have enforced structure that makes me do the harder things. This takes away the mental burden of having to decide what to do. \n\nWith these goals in mind, here is my current writing process:\n- Sparks get generated constantly. Whenever I have a spark I try to either write about it in my [remarkable](https:\/\/remarkable.com\/) or on my phone's notes app. This is a solid way to chronicle initial thoughts that is not too disruptive to my day-to-day. \n- During the week I spend one [pomodoro](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pomodoro_Technique) every day writing. I find that earlier in the day I have a larger capacity for accomplishing hard tasks. My first pomodoro of the day is devoted to this project and writing. Right before sitting down at my laptop, I meditate.\n- All of my writing work is currently done in Roam. I have one page that contains my writing notes. When I have decided I have some ideas that I want to be a piece, I turn them into a sub page. I also have a page with all of my sparks that are not fleshed out so I am still unsure if I want them to be a piece. \n- Each day I have a defined writing task\n    - Monday: Take all my sparks from my phone's notes and my remarkable. Move them to Roam. Look at sparks and see if any feel really exciting. If so start connecting ideas. \n    - Tuesday: Outline the piece that I want to publish at the end of that week\n    - Wednesday: Flesh out ideas on a couple pieces further in the future. \n    - Thursday: Fill out details for the piece this week. Goal is just to write and get ideas out. I try not to care about sentence quality.\n    - Friday: Start by reviewing the piece's structure. Make any changes if necessary. Finish getting all ideas out and start revising.\n    - Saturday: Off\n    - Sunday: Edit piece for week. Do two read throughs. Then publish\n\nThis current process means I am spending 3-4 hours a week. 2 Days I am working on pieces for future weeks and 4 days I am working on the piece for that week.\n\n***\nPart of why I turned this into a new project and made it separate from my other website is because it gave this project a new energy. The process I outlined above seems to be working well but I am sure there are opportunities for improvement. \n\nI am interested in exploring if better tools could help facilitate this process better. As I keep writing I want to identify the biggest pain points and how I might improve them. If building my own tools that are optimized for my process would have a large pay off then that is something I will try to do. \n\nA few ideas about what I would do if I built a tool:\n- Currently I have to spend time transferring my sparks into Roam. It would be nice if they just were there and organized. \n- Similarly, my page of sparks is quite long and disorganized. I could imagine something that manages sparks for you. It would resurface sparks at planned intervals or let me sample randomly from sparks. \n- I like Roam's editor for writing because it makes it really easy to drag snippets around. As I learn more about how I write, it could be worthwhile to build a custom text editor that forces certain structures and has affordances that align with what I want to do. \n"],"filename":"writing_process"},{"created":1651235454458,"modified":1676301611854,"title":"Writing Process Updates","status":"Finished","tags":["writing"],"blocks":["Project Update"],"blocks_text":["\n[Repeated Generator](\/repeated_generator) is motivated by using a writing practice to help make me a sharper thinker. Setting aside time each week to write in a way that is understandable to others helps tighten my ideas. It is also motivated by a future where I have developed a body of work that I can refer back to and which can be shared with others. \n\nFour months into the year, I have published more writing about novel ideas than in any previous year. But I also have struggled to consistently publish pieces. The pieces I have published are quite long, taking a lot of time to complete. Finishing a piece every week requires spending a sizable amount of time working over the weekend. As my weekends have started being filled with other activities, I have struggled to continue publishing pieces. Now feels like a good opportunity to take stock of how this project is going and to make any adjustments that feel necessary.\n\nThe most successful part of this project has been my how I am developing ideas. I have notes and notes filled with topics that I want to explore more deeply through writing. Most of my ideas are sparked away from the laptop when I am reading, on a walk or listening to a podcast. Having one place where I deposit all of these ideas has given me the ability to see themes in my thinking.\n\nTurning those sparks, which are normally a few sentence fragments, into a published piece has still been quite difficult. As I begin writing the scope of what I want to discuss balloons. Pieces with a large scope are difficult to organize in a coherent manner.  The larger the piece, the more editing and revising that is necessary. \n\nFor me to maintain a consistent writing practice, I have to derive joy from the practice rather than seeing it as a task that I force myself to do because it is good for me. I aspire for writing to feel the same as reading fiction on my kindle. A relaxing activity that gives me more energy than I had when I started. There are three aspects of the writing process where some mental adjustment could help make it a more joyful activity. \n---\nAs I begin expanding on an idea, I discover places where my thinking feels incomplete. Since those areas are connected to what I am writing about, it feels like they have to be addressed. That the piece would be insufficient if I did not incorporate them. This scope creep makes sense if my goal is to publish complete airtight arguments. But that would be impossible to do on a weekly basis. My writing practice is instead focused on creating a space to explore the intricacies of an idea in more depth. Rather than writing about a topic once and moving on, I want there to be repetition in my writing. Repetition means I am returning to the same themes and building depth over time. Rather than each piece being a standalone, the body of work I am developing is defined by all the different pieces coming together. \n\nDecreasing the scope of each piece is also important because the longer a piece, the more that is asked of the reader. When I am reading sometimes I get stuck reading the same sentences over and over because my mind was wandered. Good writing does not ask the reader to force themselves to pay attention. It keeps the user\u2019s attention by simulating them. One way to keep a users attention is by removing excess and focusing on brevity. \n\nMoving forward I am going to keep each piece a lot shorter. While writing I am going to cut anything that feels extra. If an idea feels really important I will return to it in a later piece. \n---\n\nWhen I begin writing, there is no structure or formula that I follow. I write down any ideas which seem to be connected. Once I start putting those ideas into paragraphs I re-organize them into a sequence mostly by intuition. I do not have tactics for determining the structure of each piece. This lack of process makes writing difficult since it forces me to regularly think about what sequencing makes the most sense. It also probably leads to a worse end product because I am not using any principles to organize my thinking.  \n\n Hanif Abdurraqib, one of my favorite writers, describes his process as moving through the following progression:\n1.  What do I not know but am curious about?\n2. What did I just find out?\n3. How can I make this exciting to someone else?\n\nHe uses this progression to formulate what each piece is going to be about. Every piece starts with something he wants to learn more about. He then has to put those learnings into a form that would be exciting to someone else. Having this process provides concrete steps that need to be taken with every creation.\n\nIt could be helpful for my creative process to have some defined steps similar Hanif\u2019s. Looking back at the pieces I have written the following progression could make sense: \n1. What is an observation about something that I care about?\n2. Why might this observed phenomena be happening?\n3. What would a world look like if this observation were different?\n\nIf I had applied that progression to this piece it might look like the following:\n1. *Observation* : I am motivated to write regularly, but I find it really difficult to do so consistently\n2. *Why:* I  find writing difficult because I try to write too much and have no structure in mind when I start creating\n3. *Difference*: Decreasing the scope of each writing piece and having a more defined process could make writing easier.\n\nFor future pieces I am going to try using this structure to formulate my ideas. I will put this small summary at the beginning of each piece. \n\n---\nOne tactic for making hard things easier is to use social accountability and community. Waking up at 6am to work out in college was always accomplished because I knew all my teammates were going to be at the gym as well. It feels more overwhelming and isolating to do things alone. \n\nWhen I bring up my motivations for writing, I mainly discuss it as something that I am doing for myself. While one of the primary audiences of each piece is myself, it also feels important to acknowledge that ideally writing would be a way to connect with others. I am putting these ideas in a form that others can digest, because I want feedback. \n\nI have found that having a particular audience in mind is a critical aspect of creating good work. When I create a presentation, it is helpful to understand what context my audience is coming in with. At work, my presentations look very different if I am presenting to my team, the entire engineering organization or the entire company. For this writing project I have neglected to pick a specific audience that I am writing for.\n\n Moving forward I am going to imagine that I am writing these pieces for my close friends. I am writing these pieces because I want their feedback, wanting to hear how their experiences are similar or different from my own. Inspired by [RFCs](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Request_for_Comments) I am thinking of referring to my writing pieces as VGCs (Vibe Generalization Checks). I am writing to check if the vibe that I am feeling generalizes to others. Going forward I am going to send out each piece as an email. \n\n\n\n"],"filename":"writing_process_updates"},{"created":1673018637432,"modified":1676301614185,"title":"Repeated Generator","status":"Finished","tags":["writing"],"blocks":["Why I am drawn to writing","Why writing is a powerful tool","The benefit of generating written artifacts","My difficulties with writing","What is Repeated Generator"],"blocks_text":["\n\nWhen Jenny (my partner) and I are in different places physically, we stay in touch through writing. This was especially the case when we were living in different cities for a year. During that year our primary mode of communication was writing emails to each other. Writing emails creates a different intimacy than talking on the phone. Writing an email can be a more reflective process than a conversation. There is no back and forth; no ability to check if the other person is comprehending what you are trying to convey. The writing process forced me to think more about how to communicate.\n\nOne of the reasons I am drawn to writing is because of the direct impact it has on my thinking. Since writing is such a different medium \/ interaction than conversation it generates different creations. It leads to my actual thoughts being different then they would be in a conversation. It is more than taking what is in my head and putting it onto paper. With writing it is important to be precise and concise. It is much more obvious when the author does not have clarity of thought because the writing is difficult to follow. I personally find that the process of writing makes me a sharper thinker.\n\nAnother reason I am drawn to writing is due to how much I am influenced by everything I read. Since I  [graduated from college](https:\/\/medium.com\/the-fox-and-the-hedgehog\/why-blog-11a7a0c166ef)  I have been trying to write more and I have often used what I was reading ( [books](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/medium\/book)  or  [papers](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/medium\/paper) ) as a jumping off point. Reading other\u2019s work allows me to learn from their experience. I can understand some of the depth of what they have learned without having to go through the same experience as them. Reading is powerful not only because I can learn from others but also because it makes me feel connected to the author. Reading someone\u2019s writing is an opportunity to understand more about the author and what motivates them to create.\n\n","\nFrom my  [initial explorations](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/)  with writing I have learned that writing is a **dynamic iterative process** of developing and refining ideas. The first step is taking an initial idea that is a simple spark and chronicling it. Moving the idea from my head and putting it onto the page. Once the idea is on the page it becomes easier to proceed with its development. I can start evaluating if it has some merit. What are the ways it needs to be pushed or expanded? By moving the idea outside of my head and onto the page I am able to interact with it differently.\n\nPutting the idea outside of myself provides a distance that makes refinement easier. When I am further away from the idea, I associate it with myself less and can do a better job of objectively understanding it. I find that writing over the course of a few days also helps provide that necessary distance. When time has passed since I last looked at the piece I am able to view it with more clarity. That cognitive shift of dissociating the idea from myself can be harder to do without the process of writing. By forcing this shift, writing helps my mind follow a process for being a strong thinker.\n\nIn this way, writing is an iterative two stage process. The first stage is putting what is in my head onto the page. I aim not to worry about quality or how others might perceive it. Now that there is an artifact I can read, I can interact with the idea in a new way. As a reader I am able to be critical of the writing and identify what needs to improve. I am forced to put myself in the shoes of someone who is not as familiar with the idea because it is not their own creation. I then go back to the step of taking what\u2019s in my head and putting it on the page. Through this process I slowly improve the piece.\n\nThis iterative process makes writing a powerful tool to help reach clarity of thought. When I am thinking about an idea only in my head it is not usually clear where the weak points are. But once I start trying to make it accessible to others, that lack of clarity becomes evident. It is most often not a problem with the communication, but rather the communication is bad because there is not clarity in the thinking. Writing without clarity is immediately evident and so if I want to be a good writer it forces me to deepen my thinking.\n","\n\nWriting is so powerful not only because of the impact it has on my thinking, but also because it generates an artifact. The creation of this artifact leads to a few really fun properties\n1. **Writing can be shared or scaled to anyone**: Once I have done the work it is then trivial to share it with others. There is the fixed cost of doing the writing, but there is essentially no extra cost for each additional person who reads it.\n2. **Writing generates a lasting chronicle**: Each writing piece is a snap shot of thinking at a given point in time. That artifact can be returned to at a later date. It can be used to better understand the author, the time period and even patterns in the authors thinking.\n3. **Writing can create a genuine connection between people**: While this connection is different than other forms of communication it is amazing that it can happen in the written medium. Really good writing connects its author to its readers in an emotional way. The best writing forms a powerful connection between the author and its readers.\n","\nWriting\u2019s beneficial impact on my thinking and the benefits of having a written chronicle are what have motivate me to write. I have mostly used my own reading as a jumping off point for writing. I have occasionally  [written pieces](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/medium\/personal)  that did not focus on another written piece but I always found it quite difficult. Writing these pieces would be a drawn out process. I would leave them in an incomplete state for a long period of time. But when I would complete those pieces, there were by far the most rewarding.\n\nWriting these pieces involved a lot of time and mental strength. While writing is a good way to reach clarity, it can also be quite difficult. Currently, it takes both intense focus and determination for me to write. While I am writing I need to both think at the local scope of an individual sentence while still ensuring that each sentence and paragraph connects to my overall point. Writing can be demoralizing at times when I keep seeing the ways I do not quite have clarity. Good writing is something that takes me a lot of time.\n\nSince I believe writing to be so beneficial, I want to find ways to not only improve my writing, but also the writing process. I want to decrease the mental energy it takes me to sit down and write. I want to be iterating on ideas over extended period of times, slowly fleshing them out. When I struggle to reach clarity, rather than being frustrated I want to recognize that is the exact the reason I am writing. Part of improving the process is changing my emotional relationship with writing and part of its developing practices that reduce as much friction as possible.\n\n","\n**Repeated Generator** is a project to help me deepen my relationship with writing, idea generation and sustainable processes. The best way to become a better writer is to write a lot. Writing a lot makes me a sharper thinker and leaves a lasting chronicle of what I am thinking about. Being forced to write something novel every week will necessitate that I develop a system that makes writing easier. This project is as much about developing a writing process as it is about doing the actual writing.\n\nI am going to publish one writing piece every week on Sunday night. While I want each piece to be high quality and something I put time into, the main focus is about putting in time every week. I want to give myself the chance to try out different types of writing. Not every piece is going to be perfect the first time around. As long as I am constantly devoting time to this project each week and publishing something, it will be a huge success.\nWhile I am excited to see where my mind goes and what I end up writing about, there are a few topics I already know I want to explore. These are:\n* The writing process and how this project is going\n* The future of certain technologies - I want to chronicle my opinions and see how they compare to what actually happens\n* Believe formation at both the individual level and societal level. How public opinion has changed\n* The science of doing science, the history of science and knowledge creation\n"],"filename":"repeated_generator"},{"created":1654512279413,"modified":1676301623394,"title":"Crypto and wealth creation","status":"Finished","tags":["crypto"],"blocks":["Motivation ","Model for understanding wealth","How crypto might create wealth","What is wealth?","More Questions"],"blocks_text":["\nWhat I find appealing about the web3 \/ crypto space is it\u2019s [transformative vision of the future](https:\/\/repeatedgenerator.netlify.app\/posts\/week_3_here_to_now\/).

To dig deeper on this I begin with some building blocks we might need to answer this question. \n","\nIn my undergraduate studies we encountered macroeconomic models for how a countries wealth changes ([GDP](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gross_domestic_product) is the traditional measure used). Measuring the wealth of an entire country is complex so these models use simplifications to make the task manageable. Some of the simplest models use population growth as the driver of wealth. A countries\u2019 wealth is dependent on how much labor is available. As the population grows so does the amount of possible labor. More labor = more wealth. This link between labor and wealth makes sense at personal level. I work for a company which  pays me money increasing my personal wealth. I use my labor to increase my wealth. \n\nIf we dig a bit deeper on the relationship between labor and wealth a lot of complexity bubbles up. Some thoughts about this relationship based on my own experiences\n\n\t\t\t* Not all labor is equal. One project might create more wealth than another. One person working on that project might create different amounts of wealth than another. We recognize this by paying people different amounts and different jobs paying different amounts\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t* Increasing the amount of labor does not simply map to how wealth will increase. If I worked on a project for 20hrs rather than 10hrs would the amount of wealth that I generate double? There is most likely not a linear relationship between amount of labor and amount of wealth.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t* The amount of wealth I generate with an hour of labor changes over my lifetime. As I have more experience, develop more skills, one hour of my time becomes more productive. This is manifested in more senior workers getting paid a higher salary  recognizing that their time is more valuable. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t* The amount of wealth I generate is not only dependent on my ability but also the tools that I have at my disposable. Without a computer it would be really hard for me to work. \n\nMacroeconomic models have different specifications to deal with these complexities. They take into account capital accumulation (how much I have spent on tools),  technological progress \/ productivity (How helpful those tools are) and even knowledge accumulation (how much experience I have) . There is one aspect  which shows up in most of these models that I have not touched on yet;  the investment \/ savings rate.\n\nAnother way to grow my personal wealth is by investing the wealth I receive from labor into other sources. Investing money is hopefully a mutually beneficial relationship between the investor and the company.  The investor fronts the company to help them create something that will generate wealth later give. Eventual the company will capture some of the wealth they are creating. The company should then return that wealth to the investor. In exchange for the investor giving the company money now, the money received in the future should be larger than what they invested.  This agreement is easiest to understand with companies that pay out [dividends](investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dividend.asp). Eventually the investors earns back their [principal ](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/principal.asp)  and then some. \n\nWhile investments in our present day society have become more complicated, this type of relationship is really important for wealth creation. Investment acts as a **coordination mechanism** allowing projects to be funded that otherwise would not exist. In exchange for allowing others to work on a project, investors have the opportunity to grow their own wealth. In the macroeconomic models countries with a higher investment rate grow their wealth quicker. This higher investment rate means more projects are attempted. \n\nThere are many economists who spend their full time studying these concepts. My quick explanations do not do their work justice, but having this foundation will be important for understanding crypto\u2019s wealth generation.\n","\nIn the framework we have been exploring there are two components:  A group of people and a measure the wealth they hold. That group of people could be an individual, an organization, or a country. For each of these groups we have a way of measuring their wealth. For an individual it is the sum of their assets, for a company it is it\u2019s valuation and for the country it is GDP. The amount of wealth of the group depends on  labor, technological progress and investment.\n\nIn our society we use currency as the unit to measure wealth. My personal wealth measurement, a company\u2019s valuation and GDP are all in units of dollars. Currency is a unit that allows us to compare very different assets. We are able to compare the value of an apple to that of a pear. The value of a flight across the country to the value of a laptop.\n\nNow that we have a framework, let\u2019s return to our original question, **How is crypto generating wealth**?  For crypto to be generating wealth we need to identify our two components. The group of people is people who own crypto assets (bitcoin, ethereal etc\u2026). The measure of wealth is the total value of those crypto assets. Crypto is generating wealth because the value of those assets are increasing.  Using our framework two possibilities emerge about why the value of those assets are increasing:\n1. Crypto assets are investments in a new technology which has the potential to generate wealth. \n2. Crypto assets are a new currency representing a larger share of wealth that already existed. \n\nUnderstanding crypto is difficult because it is a new financial instrument. It does not map neatly into our previous categories. It is simultaneously both a currency and an investment in a new technology\n\n**Crypto assets are investments in a new technology which has the potential to generate wealth.** \nWe can simplify buying crypto to be making an investment in a new technology. Buying crypto gives the people working on that technology money. For your investment to be worth it, the technology eventually must create wealth that will be returned to you. A tricky thing about investments though, is that they are based on people\u2019s expectations about the future. If people\u2019s expectations about the wealth crypto will generate are much larger than the truth, then we will have a [crypto bubble](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economic_bubble). \n\n2. **Crypto is a new currency that represents wealth which already existed**\nWe could also simplify crypto to being a new currency. Each unit of currency represents a certain amount of wealth. Crypto becoming worth more means that other currencies are becoming worth slightly less. In this world crypto is not creating wealth but rather representing a larger share of existing wealth.\n\nCrypto does not fit neatly into either one of these categories. It\u2019s wealth generation could be derived from both of them. Crypto is a new financial instrument coupled with a transformative vision of the future. Some of the excitement about crypto is about the possibilities with the new technology, but a lot of it has also been about how this new financial instrument has generated a lot of wealth for people. Whether or not crypto actually generates wealth in the long term will be decided by the people in the crypto community. If the resources they have gained from this financial instrument are actually used to create value then it will not be a wealth transfer mechanism but a wealth generating one.  \n\n","\nWhile writing this piece, there has been a question I have avoided which has been nagging me. **What actually is wealth?**  So much of our society is organized around wealth. There is an inherent assumption that more wealth is desirable and we should aim to grow our measured wealth. \n\nAt some level, there needs to be a connection between wealth and our values. When I purchase an item, I am stating that I value that item. The amount of money that I pay for it is a measure of how much I value it. In theory, wealth should be strongly connected with improvements in the human condition. When we are creating wealth we are doing something that improves people\u2019s lives.\n\nBut clearly, wealth does not perfectly represent improvement in human life. People who are wealthier are not always better off. There are many things which improve the human condition which currently are not taken into account in wealth measurements. In a healthy society our measurement of wealth is probably quite closely tied to actual improvements in the human condition.\n\n","\nThis exploration has been helpful, but it has left me with even more questions than I started with. Some of those are: \n\t* If  our current measures of wealth do not accurately represent human health \/ values what do they represent?\n\n\t* While wealth does not perfectly represent human values, there still is some connection. What happens to our understanding of wealth as human values change? If everyone started valuing public spaces a lot more how would that change our understanding of wealth? \n\n\t* Our financial system has become quite complicated. Does all this complication create a better and more robust system? How do we measure if  our system is working well? It feels like our system is quite susceptible to bubbles currently. The complication has made it difficult to actually value an asset.  \n\n\t* How does currency exchange work? What does it mean when one currency becomes more or less valuable? \n\nThanks to  Basil Halperin, Holly Ormseth, and Jenny Wang for discussions that inspired this exploration.

Andy\u2019s work is quite inspiring, pushing me to re-evaluate why I read and how I can get more out of it. I spend so much time reading that there would be large returns to making that time more effective. \n\nOrbit is centered on bringing [spaced repetition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spacing_effect) into the reading experience. Spaced repetition uses software to schedule flashcard review to aid moving information into long term memory. Essentially it surfaces a fact you want to remember, right before you are about to forget it.  You simply inform the software \u201cI want to remember X\u201c  and the system\u2019s scheduling makes sure that you do. Spaced repetition is so powerful because minimal time investment greatly increases how much information can be retained.\n\nWhile spaced repetition seems so compelling, and I have multiple friends who swear by it, I have been unable to effectively practice it. Multiple times, I have created a bunch of cards, but I have failed to consistently commit to reviewing the cards.\n\nSome of the reasons why I have struggled to consistently apply spaced repetition are:\n1.  Reviewing cards can feel a little contrived. When I review, it does not feel connected to any of my goals. It feels like I am studying cards  so that I have some information in case it might be helpful later.\n2. When I review it is divorced from the original context where I encountered the information. I sometimes am not sure why I thought this fact was important. \n3. Creating review cards while I am reading,  degrades the reading experience. When I am reading I do not want to be taken out of the experience. \n\t* Andy has built some prototypes where card creation is embedded in the reading experience. This co-location vastly improves the experience of creating cards.\n4. Once I get behind on reviewing cards, there is a large backlog of cards I am supposed to review. This backlog becomes overwhelming  making me avoid review entirely. \n\nI am fully convinced that having a spaced repetition practice would help me, so I want to find a way to consistently review cards. Committing to any new practice consistently is difficult. Especially one with no immediate pay off. A similar type of practice which I have at times struggled to do, but generally do consistently is meditation. I have made meditating on a daily basis a lot easier by reading about meditation. Reading about meditation reminds me of my motivation to practice. I am going to try a similar tactic for spaced repetition. \n\nI read the three pieces below about spaced repetition:  \n\n- [Augmenting Long-term Memory](http:\/\/augmentingcognition.com\/ltm.html)\n- [Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning](https:\/\/www.gwern.net\/Spaced-repetition)\n- [How To Remember Anything Forever-ish](https:\/\/ncase.me\/remember\/)\n\n","\n\nReading the articles has reinvigorated my motivation for having a spaced repetition practice. There were a few pieces of information in the articles that will help improve my practice. They are: (Note: The Michael Nielsen article was by far the best one)\n\n1. Spaced repetition is a skill that I need to practice. Creating cards that I am motivated to learn which prompt me in the correct way is a skill. Since creating cards is a skill,  it makes sense that I might have struggled to adopt the practice. I need to build up my space repetition skills.\n2. I should begin my practice with a use case that has the following properties: \n\t1. It is a space where memorizing a lot of information is very helpful\n\t2. It is an area that I am  newer to\n\t3. It is an area where I am  very motivated\nStarting with this type of subject will help me develop the skills necessary to tackle subjects which are not as good of a fit. \n3. Turning a piece of information into question and answer is part of the process. Spaced repetition is much more effective for cards that I have created  rather than generic cards someone has created about a subject. \n4. Spaced repetition is about helping me maintain rather than helping me learn or build.\n\nI am going to start by focusing on all the reading I have done about meditation as a use case. This is an area where I am taking in a lot of new information, have had trouble maintaining all of it and am very motivated to learn it.\n\n","\n\nWhile I hope the above adjustments will support me having a consistent high quality spaced repetition practice, there are also ways to improve my software tooling to make the experience more approachable. \n\n1. As I mentioned before, having the process of creating cards directly embedded in the reading medium is really helpful. \n2. To further improve my reading experience, I would prefer to not have to create the card while reading. Instead I could simply highlight a section and optionally add a note.  As part of my review process, I would also be prompted to turn my highlights into question and answers. \n3. When I am reviewing, when I see the answer side of the card, I also want to then see the original context the information is from.  I could see the original quote that I first highlighted. \n4. The review process should also involve some amount of filtering of cards. While I am reading, I want there to be low friction to highlighting. When I am turning into questions later, I can easily discard a highlight and not have it in my review deck. \n\nThese extensions could make the card generation process a lot easier by not degrading my reading experience. A good opportunity to try this flow out would be with books read on the Kindle. I can easily highlight on the Kindle. \n\n","\n\nI have noticed a similarity between the mechanics of spaced repetition and increasing the effectiveness of my time with other activities. If I have fixed amount of time to work on a task, **it is best to spread that time across different sessions**.  Spaced repetition works by spreading my 30 minutes of memorization across multiple days.  Here are some other activities where spreading my time across multiple sessions seems to be more effective: \n\n**Reading an academic paper**\nIn his article Nielsen describes reading an academic paper across multiple different sittings. He starts by doing a skim of the paper, simply aiming to absorb the main ideas. This first read allows him to  delve deeper into the details with a subsequent pass. A third read can go even deeper. Each additional read he understands more of the paper. Once he understands the first ten percent of the paper, it then becomes easier to understand the next twenty percent. \n\nThis technique matches my experience with reading difficult papers. Often with a difficult paper, there are complex details that I do not fully understand initially. It is usually fruitless to keep spending more time trying to understand them on my first sitting. I have had much more success returning to those details in a later session.\n\n**My own experience with writing**\nI have found that returning to a writing piece many times, across multiple days, creates a much better product than writing in one sitting. It is almost impossible to write a good piece in one sitting. Touching a piece multiple times across a number of days on the other hand creates a much more cohesive and dynamic argument. This same principle applies to creating presentations for work.\n\nThese commonalities between other tasks and memorizing information might be a coincidence, but there might also be something mechanistic that creates this effect. Here are some initial reasons why spreading our time across multiple sessions creates a better product:\n1. Within a session, there are decreasing returns to my time. The first ten minutes are the most valuable, then the second twenty minutes and so on.  \n2. Most activities actually require a few different types of work. For writing you need to organize ideas, write prose and revise. Different sessions make it easier to cognitively shift between these different types. Within one session it is hard to make that necessary switch.\n3. Knowing you can work on a task over multiple days means there is no time pressure. This removes some anxiety which was inhibiting your work ability.\n4. The time in between sessions is actually valuable time. While you are not directly working on the task, the task is in your mid space and some amount of integration or synthesis is happening.\n\nWhile there might be some truth in all of these suggestions, the one that seems most applicable to memorization of material is the last one. \n\n","\nOne of the struggles I mentioned early with spaced repetition is connecting practicing cards with goals that I want to achieve. Andy refers to this property as **transfer**. I think by adding additional activities to my review of cards, I might be able to increase how much I am transferring the benefit from my review to other activity. I am interested extending my review  by adding more structure to how cards are connected.\n\nIn the simplest example, we could have a compound card which is a synthesize of two cards. When you review these cards it would show you that they are connected to each other. After glancing at your answer to one card, you also have the option to glance at the other cards. There would also need to be an affordance in the review that allows connections to be formed between cards. Over time my spaced repetition cards might look similar to a [Zettelkasten deck](https:\/\/zettelkasten.de\/introduction\/).  I would not only be remembering more information, but also connecting that information in dynamic ways. Often I am doing reading, to help push and expand my own idea generation \/ writing practice. This web of connecting cards could help me see all the information I am trying to retain in certain directions.\n\nSimilarly, I could use use writing to condense the amount of cards I have about a subject. When I first read a paper I might have 20 cards related to different ideas in the paper. But after subsequent reviews, it might become clearer to me what aspects are actually the most important.  I can slowly synthesize those cards to be just 1 or 2. Those 20 cards represent a summary of what I wanted to take away from the paper. Spaced repetition is a compression of the original source text. As more information is moved into my long term memory I can compress that information even more. So eventually the card might just be summarize the main takeaways from this paper.\n\n\n"],"filename":"getting_spaced_repetition_to_work"},{"created":1676542786909,"modified":1676543232861,"title":"Learning Mandarin","status":"In Progress","tags":["learning","top_of_mind"],"blocks":["Motivation","Approach"],"blocks_text":["\n* Wanting to connect with Jennys family\n* always struggled learning languages growing up\n* one of the things I would be the most proud about\n* Would feel like it was a really important thing that I did\n* give me confidence that I can do other difficult things\n\n","\n- It is all about consistency over a long period of time rather than making a real big effort in a short period of time\n- trying both babble and pimseler\n- watching Chinese television"],"filename":"learning_mandarin"},{"created":1675834979228,"modified":1677590708445,"title":"The Impact of Large Language Models","status":"Finished","tags":["looking_forward","intelligence","products","highlights"],"blocks":["My understanding of how these tools work","My use cases with these tools","Impacts of LLMs on Product Design","Impact on work"],"blocks_text":["\nIt feels like now is a good time to summarize my feelings on recent developments in artificial intelligence especially relating to large language models (LLMS). There has been a lot of excitement recently about chat interfaces using LLMs such as [ChatGPT](https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/api\/auth\/error), [Perplexity](https:\/\/www.perplexity.ai\/) and [BingChat](https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/blog\/2023\/02\/07\/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web\/). \n\nOver the past few months I have been experimenting with how to incorporate these tools into my life. A lot of the excitement around these tools has been related to using prompt injection to discover how the tools was created. These discoveries have been so exciting because they give insight into how these teams created the tools. My biggest takeaway from these explorations is that **prompt completion is an extremely powerful and versatile primitive**.  \n\n Fundamentally LLMs are predicting what sequence of letters should come after an initial sequence of letters. The magical nature of ChatGPT derives from how they have built an interface around this functionality. The interface actually makes it seem like the model is doing something more complicated than prompt completion. The interface moves away from [prompt completion](https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/playground) towards a question and answer model. The team at OpenAI was able to make this move by converting a chat interaction into a text sequence behind the scenes. Even though it feels like ChatGPT is doing something else, it is still simply predicting what letters should come after another set of letters. \n\nOne of the most astounding things about the recent excitement is how long GPT3 has been available for. GPT3 has been available for over two years! While I know that OpenAI has continually rolled out new updates to the model to make it better, the fundamental technology has been available for a while. The **prompt completion** interface is so unintuitive to us, that it has taken us a long time to figure out how to create products around this technology.\n\nWhile OpenAI will continue to improve their LLMs I actually believe the fundamental building blocks to create really intelligent agents is already here. A lot of the advancements in building more complex agents will come from figuring out ways to handle memory and condensing information. \n","\nWhile a lot of excitement about these tools has been related to better understanding their capabilities and how they were built, they are also quite good tools. I have adopted a couple of these tools into my workflow in fairly specific ways.\n\n**ChatGPT** is incredible at answering coding questions. Its ability to generate code on the spot that works exactly as I want it to is remarkable. Also when the answer it provides is not exactly what I am looking for, it is able to revise its answer or change something. This is such an improvement over interacting with stack overflow. With stack overflow I have to hope that someone has the exact same question as me. If the question is close, but still somewhat dissimilar I can\u2019t adjust the question to be exactly my situation. If I want a deeper understanding of the code that **ChatGPT** generated I can also ask follow up questions. I cannot stress enough how much of an improvement **ChatGPT** is for this use case.\n\nPart of the reason **ChatGPT** is such a good tool for when I have coding questions, is that I can immediately verify if the solution provided works. I copy the code, run it immediately and see if it produces the intended output. This is different from a lot of other searches. When I have searching for information, I cannot execute the information that was returned to verify that it is accurate.  Due to this difference for more information based searches I still use google over ChatGPT. Google provides an array of different sources which I can reference or compare to each other. ChatGPT on the other hand provides one answer in a voice that is overly verbose. Using google search I am able to assess the quality of the information by comparing multiple sources and using background knowledge about the trustworthiness of a source. So for now, ChatGPT has not replaced search, but whenever I need anything coding related I go to ChatGPT rather than google. \n\nThe other tool that I have adopted into my workflow is [Elicit](https:\/\/elicit.org\/). Elicit uses LLMs to facilitating searching, reading and synthesizing academic research. Sometimes I am interested in specifically the academic consensus opinion on a topic rather than the opinion of the entire internet.  Elicit finds multiple papers relevant to my search while also giving me the ability to dig deeper on any one paper. Elicit strikes a really nice balance of giving me flexibility while also providing a more curated experience than generic search. \n","\nLLMs will have a wide impact on our creative future. Many new tools are going to be created that leverage this technology. I am going to touch on a couple of different ways that new tools will utilize LLMs.\n\n **LLMs have unlocked a new design primitive that gives users more control of their tools**. Tools built with LLMs can allow users to give direct feedback to the tool about its performance. ChatGPT\u2019s improvement over search is from the ability to ask follow ups. Asking follow ups gives users a finer grained ability to direct the tool. Users are less constrained by developers predicting their every want. While this follow up interface is quite intuitive for chat, it can be extended to non chat interfaces. For example, when Elicit returns a list of papers  it could also provide functionality for me to give feedback about the quality of those results. I could tell Elicit in free text about how well those papers match to what I am looking for. The ability to give a tool realtime feedback in plain text gives users more ability to customize a tool to their needs. \n\n**Tools built using LLMs will trend towards using an assembly of models rather than one singular model**. My understanding is that ChatGPT is built on one model that answers questions. A question is fed into it and a response is returned. I believe future LLM based tools will have multiple models that are interacting with each other. By multiple models I do not necessarily mean models with different weights, but **models with different purposes**. For example, a chat interface might have one model that cleans the users input, another model which searches the web, and another model that verifies if the result is a good one or not. When a tool uses multiple different models,  each model can specialize in handling a smaller task. This organization of intelligence is similar to how we often organize human intelligence.  In organizations, we are able to create a better outcome by assembling many different intelligences into specialized roles.  \n\n**LLM based tools will moved towards being domain specific**. Our first set of tools has been domain agnostic since domain agnostic tools can have the largest reach. Since ChatGPT can be asked any question, it can used for a large number of different use cases. Elicit is a beginning example of a more domain specific tool. As more creators understand how to use LLMs and the cost to use LLMs comes down, we will see the creation of tools that are tightly tied to specific contexts. While being domain specific does limit the reach of a tool, it also allows the tool to provide more value for that context than something general purpose like ChatGPT. \n\nLastly, I am excited for teams to explore creating completely new products that were not possible before LLMs. For this discussion so far, I have mostly focused on how LLMs will create better tools by utilizing a new technology. As we become more experienced with LLMs there will also be tools that are quite different from anything that exists today. One place I would look for the beginnings of this is dynamic cooperative story telling. I am grounding this idea in how LLMs might be used to improve character creation in games. A large part of many games is interacting with other characters. Currently these non playable characters (NPCs) are often quite limited. Using LLMs to make these characters more dynamic could change how stories are built. Creators will no longer have to specify every single interaction but can use the intelligence of LLMs to explore scenarios. \n","\nWhenever there are advances in artificial intelligence a predominate narrative is \u201cWhat impact will this have on work?\u201c I have heard many people express a similar concern of \u201cChatGPT is going to automate our jobs\u201c. I understand this narrative as deriving from anxieties about the commodization of our skills. We focus on \u201cwork\u201c because many of us tie the value of our intelligence to our ability at work.  While I understand how creating dynamic intelligence raises questions about our identities, I believe that LLMs impact on work will not be fundamentally different from the introduction of other technologies. \n\nBy making certain tasks easier to accomplish LLMs will change how we spend our time, moving us to higher levels of abstraction. If we view this shift using our current standards, we will see a large increase in quality of creation. But because everyone will have access to LLMs our understanding of quality will also change. I am going to work through an example for how I see this dynamic playing out.\n\nIn the previous section I touched on how game creators might no longer need to write dialogue for NPCs. Before LLMs writing good dialogue was an important skill. It was necessary to specify the entire interaction and write all of the dialogue. Using LLMs, it might not be necessary anymore to write all of the dialogue. Instead the creator will write brief personalities for the characters and a description of the scenario. The creator no longer has to think at the level of the individual dialogue but rather can think at the level of setting up the scene. Creating a dynamic scene will still require skill and there will still be individuals who are better or worse at this skill. But the skill that is important has now changed. \n\nWhile LLMs will not completely automate our work, they will have differential impact on people with different types of jobs. A different set of skills will now be valuable relative to the past. It can be quite difficult for individuals to transition from one set of skills to another. Making this transition is probably harder than learning the new skill from scratch. Learning new skills can be easier than having to unlearn the old skill and learn the new skill. This creates a difficult dynamic especially for those who are less able to adapt to the new situation. I would say in previous situations we have done a bad job handling this.  As manufacturing jobs become less valuable and we switched towards more knowledge based work lots of people were hurt. It is important for us to recognize that this shift is happening and have discussions about how to handle individuals who will have a harder time adapting.\n"],"filename":"the_impact_of_large_language_models"},{"created":1668506628346,"modified":1677590721160,"title":"Meditation in the year of 2022","status":"Finished","tags":["meditation","highlights"],"blocks":["Introduction","What Changed this Year","Current State","Advice for New Meditators","Looking Forward"],"blocks_text":["\n\nI have been practicing meditation  for over 5 years since my junior year of college. I began meditating because I felt out of touch with my feelings in a harmful way. I was fairly regularly  disregulated because I was avoiding some difficulties in my life. It felt like every week there was a new crises. Meditation offered a way to help settle down some of that agitation. \n\nWhile the practice has been a part of my life this whole time, this year meditation has became a much more effective tool which has a profound impact on my day to day experience. I now use meditation to support myself in multiple different ways which has contributed to an increase in my overall well being. I now spend minimal time disregulated, I have a lot of energy on a daily basis and I am much more resilient when something unfortunate happens. \n\nDuring these five years I have also spent a lot of energy on understanding what other factors impact my health. I have explored what types of foods I should be eating and when, how I should be scheduling my exercise, what type of exercise to be doing, how much I should be sleeping and many other practices about how to improve my health. While that exploration has led to some insights, it has become clear this year that meditation can have such a profound impact in a way that a lot of these other things do not. \n\nThe expansion of my meditation practice this year has pushed me to understand the practice itself more deeply. I am going to use this writing piece to explore what I did different this year and why it might have moved mr practice forward so much.  I am also interested in exploring what might I have done differently to help my  practice reach a similar place earlier.\n","\nBefore this year, I was interested in going on a meditation retreat, but I was hesitant because I was scared. Meditating for 20 minutes a day was hard enough, what would it be like to meditate for multiple days in a row!? I started off 2022 by going on a meditation retreat at IMS with Jenny. We did a short retreat of only three days which felt more manageable than committing to ten day retreat. Knowing that I was going on the retreat with some one else and that we would have a shared experience made me a lot less scared. I knew there was someone else in the meditation hall that cared for me which made me feel a lot less alone.\n\nTruthfully, going on retreat was really really hard. I struggled with drowsiness everyday. I struggled with physical discomfort. While retreat was quite hard,  it was incredibly important because I was able to find mental states, that I had not accessed before. Later in the retreat, there were moments where I found a very precise focus on my breath which lead to a deep calm. Eating dinner on the last night I had a deep sense of presence with the meal which led to overwhelming contentment. Returning from retreat I had a sense why serious meditators  believe retreat us such a vital part of practice. Retreat is a container to access states of mind that are elusive in our day to day experience. Another benefit  I received from retreat was the sense of accomplishment from completing something that I was scared of. \n\nIn hindsight, it feels like going on retreat layed the groundwork for my practice to deepen this year. Nothing immediately changed in my practice. I still struggled to sit every day, usually only sitting 3-4 times a week. When I did sit, I struggled a lot with physical discomfort and quieting my mind. To keep furthering my practice, I signed up for two day long retreats in April at a retreat center in Boston. My experience at both of these was similar to the longer retreat earlier in the year. I had a fair amount of difficult sitting for such an extended period of time, but also got glimpses into what my practice could look like moving forward. \n\nAround the same time, I  started meeting with my friends Alex and Stephan to discuss meditation weekly. Part of the motivation for meeting with them, was feeling alienated by the Q & A sessions that happened on the retreats I went on. The other people who went on retreats felt like they were in different places with their practice and struggled with different problems. I wanted to have conversations about my practice with people who I felt connected to at a personal level, but also whose lives were in a similar situation to my own. Meeting with Stephen and Alex every week forced me to reflect on my practice. I had to precisely articulate what I was experiencing in my body. Every week I shared what was going well in my practice and what I was struggling with. Not only did this meeting force me to reflect, but Alex and Stephen also gave me advice, connecting my own experience to their practice. \n\nAfter a couple months of meeting with Alex and Stephen I also started increasing the amount I was reading about meditation. Often during our meetings, someone would make a reference to some text they had read. Both Stephen and Alex regularly referred to the Mind Illuminated. During this time period, I made a couple changes to my practice which moved meditating from a chore into something I enjoyed. I stopped sitting in uncomfortable positions and I started reading a little bit about meditation before every sit. Sitting upright in a comfortable chair removed a lot of the physical discomfort that I struggled with while sitting cross legged. Reading passages about meditation before sitting helped increase my motivation and excitement about sitting.  These improvements  made it a lot easier for me to develop a regular practice. Rather than coercing myself to sit everyday, meditation became something that I sought out and actually enjoyed. This made it so much easier to have a daily practice, which in turn made it easier to move further in my practice. It felt like I unlocked some sort of feedback loop that made it easier for me to keep moving forward.\n\nAnother big part of this feedback loop involved the Jhanas. At the beginning of the year I read Leigh\u2019s book about the Jhanas. I am planning to write a whole piece devoted just to my experience with the Jhanas, but accessing the Jhanas helped turn meditation into something that could be a pleasurable experience. This in turn made it easier to sit, which then made it easier for me to enjoy meditation even more. \n\nThe last shift that happened in my practice, came from experimenting with different types of meditations. For the first four years of my practice, almost all of my sits had been quite similar, struggling to focus on my breath. During this year, I started doing lovingkindness on occasion. At first I found lovingkindness meditation to feel somewhat fake or contrived. But as I did the practice more, I have found lovingkindness meditations to be transformative in a different way than breathe focused sits. Through a regular practice, I am actually able to transform my relationships with others and feel so much more love in my everyday life. This has expanded my understanding of what meditation can be. As I mentioned in the intro, a meditation practice can impact my life in many different ways. Different practices have different impacts. Depending on what has been going on in my life, I can pick the practice that feels best suited to deliver what I currently need.\n","\n\n\nAt the end of 2022, the current state of my practice is:\n\t- I sit almost everyday. It is usually the second thing that I do in the day. I do some physical activity first to help me wake up and remove the drowsiness that is there upon immediately waking up.\n\t- Before I formally begin practice, I do about 10-20 minutes of reading from a book about meditation. This helps ground me in why I am sitting and build motivation for the coming practice.\n\t- I sit in a comfortable chair for either 20 or 35 minutes. I start almost every practice with some loving kindness meditation. I normally first practice receiving love from others and then I practice sending love to others.\n\t- After that I try to relax as much as possible and find pleasant sensations in my body. I do not spend a ton of time focusing on my breath, but will use the breath to check in if my mind wanders. When I notice my mind wandering, I try to cue up a feeling of achievement. Every time I notice my mind wandering it is an accomplishment  I am proud of. Rather than returning to the breath, I try to relax and let the breath pop back in.\n\t- If I do encounter drowsiness in my practice I do a small breathing exercise where I breathe aggressively out of my nose quite quickly a few times. This generally removes the drowsiness as I am feeling it and allows me to start noticing it earlier and earlier.\n\t- Once or twice a week I like to sit with some audio stimulus playing.  Generally something from this [YouTube channel](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@magnetic_minds)\n\nOver the past year here is what I have read about meditation:\n\t* [Right Concentration](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Right-Concentration-Practical-Guide-Jhanas\/dp\/1611802695)\n\t* [The Science of Enlightenment](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Science-Enlightenment-How-Meditation-Works-ebook\/dp\/B01KUGQYJO\/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1EZ0FVYEBKX22&keywords=shinzen+young&qid=1670808694&s=books&sprefix=shinzen+young,stripbooks,104&sr=1-3)\n\t* [The Mind Illuminated](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness-ebook\/dp\/B01INMZKAQ\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=NLKAD8FM9JQW&keywords=the+mind+illuminated+by+john+yates&qid=1670808720&s=books&sprefix=the+mind+i,stripbooks,96&sr=1-1)\n\t* [Zen mind, beginners mind](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Zen-Mind-Beginners-50th-Anniversary-ebook\/dp\/B086J7X4GV\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=11RL4VGSYHS65&keywords=zen+mind+beginners+mind+by+shunryu+suzuki&qid=1670808778&s=books&sprefix=zen+mind+,stripbooks,92&sr=1-1)\n\t* [Awakening Through Love](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Awakening-Through-Love-Unveiling-Goodness\/dp\/0861715373\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1KPZ8ZBYVLCXQ&keywords=john+makransky&qid=1670808800&s=books&sprefix=jon+mak,stripbooks,102&sr=1-1)\n\t* [Romeo Stevens Blog](http:\/\/neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com\/)\n\t* [The Neuroscience of Meditation](https:\/\/opentheory.net\/2018\/12\/the-neuroscience-of-meditation\/)\n\n","\n\nFairly regularly I get asked by friends about advice I have for people who are new to meditation. I know many people who are intrigued by the practice, but struggle with it . They are curious about how to work through difficulties they are having. While this reflection has been centered on my own experience five years into meditation, I actually think there are a lot of lessons that can be applied to help beginners make progress with their practice. Here is a list with some advice I would give to newer practitioners roughly ordered in terms of importance:\n\n* Your primary focus should be on making the practice as enjoyable \/ relaxing as possible. We will always struggle to do something regularly which is unpleasant. Start by blocking off some time everyday to take for yourself. Dedicate a half hour everyday to do something which increases your health. I recommend blocking this time off towards the beginning of the day. At the beginning of the day I have more energy, I have distractors and more likely to stick to the plan. While ideally, this time could be for meditating it really does not have to be. Explore what practices you find make you feel healthy. I think doing some [Yoga Nidra](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yoga_nidra) could be a good way for some people to start exploring meditative practice.\n\n* As you begin your practice, the most important thing is finding teachers you connect with. There are many different ways to find teachers. You could read some books, go to meditation retreats or attend meditation classes. So many teachers are teaching online now, which has dramatically increased access to high quality meditation instruction. Different types of teachers are going to be best for different individuals so it is important to try out some different teachers and find the way that works best for you! [IMS](https:\/\/www.dharma.org\/) and [Spirit Rock](https:\/\/www.spiritrock.org\/) will both have lists of many teachers\n\n* Continuing in that vain, think about your practice as an opportunity to experiment! There are many different types of meditation practices out there. Different practices will be better suited to some than others. Commit to trying out a practice for a month or so and see how it feels. Notice what you like \/ what feels good about the practice and what you dislike. At the beginning I would say switching to a new practice every month or so seems like a good cadence. It is really important to explore and see what is out there.\n\n* As you are experimenting with different practices, it is important to reflect on which practices you find to be the most meaningful. If you had a sit that felt particularly good, what where the conditions that led to it. Also, if you had a sit that was particularly bad reflect on the conditions that led to it. Using this process of experimentation and reflection you should be able to learn about what helps you have a good practice. I would highly recommend trying to have a peer group that you meet with regularly to talk about the practice. Meeting with friends is fun!! It makes the practice feel a lot less isolated and others often have advice that is quite helpful. Try to find a couple of friends who are also interested and commit to meeting semi regularly to talk about your experience.\n\n* The last thought might be the simplest but also the most important:  the most important determinant of progress is consistency. If you have a regular practice, you will absolutely make progress with the practice. I think it is even possible that there is a feedback loop where the further you get in your practice the easier it will be. The beginning will be the hardest. As you practice more, sitting more will get easier and then it will be easier to have a more consistent practice. \n\n","\nIn this past year, I feel like I have made tremendous progress in my meditation practice, which has had real positive impacts on my life. I am so excited about containing to develop my practice further.  It feels like there is still such opportunity to deepen my practice in many ways. When I was starting my practice, there were topics which advanced meditators talked about which made no sense to me. As I have gotten further in my practice though, some of those things have started to actually make sense. That is exciting, because there are still things more advanced meditators talk about, which I do not understand at all. \n\nLooking forward to the next year I have some things I am really looking forward to. I have two retreats scheduled for this year. Some material related to meditation I am particular excited about consuming this year:\n- [The Heart of the Buddhas Teachings](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Heart-Buddhas-Teaching-Transforming-Liberation\/dp\/0767903692)\n- [LovingKindness](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lovingkindness-Revolutionary-Happiness-Shambhala-Library\/dp\/1611806240\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1W01NCZ8NX441&keywords=lovingkindness&qid=1670810494&s=books&sprefix=lovingkidness,stripbooks,142&sr=1-1)\n- [Vividness](https:\/\/vividness.live\/)\n- [Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mastering-Core-Teachings-Buddha-Unusually\/dp\/1911597108)\n- [After the Ecstasy the Laundry](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/After-Ecstasy-Laundry-Heart-Spiritual\/dp\/0553378295\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3839129DRPMRW&keywords=after+the+ecstasy,+the+laundry+by+jack+kornfield&qid=1670810659&s=books&sprefix=after+the+e,stripbooks,94&sr=1-1)\n- [Natural great Perfection](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Natural-Great-Perfection-Dzogchen-Teachings\/dp\/1559393122)\n- [I Am That](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Am-That-Talks-Nisargadatta-Maharaj-dp-8185300534\/dp\/8185300534\/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)\n\n\n\n"],"filename":"meditation_in_the_year_of_2022"},{"created":1675834549473,"modified":1677661920080,"title":"Glyph MVP","status":"In Progress","tags":["glyph"],"blocks":["Grid Experiment"],"blocks_text":["\n\nThis is a thought exercise on what would be the minimal thing we could build that we should ship\n- we would deploy it at a website so that people could interact with it\n- It would not have a long lived database.

This past year was such a hard year for so many people. Whether it was loved ones passing away, financial hardships or just emotional well being and stability. While 2020 was very different that I imagined, my safety was never challenged and that is something I am incredibly thankful for.\n\n2020 forced all of us to recognize what we previously we might have ignored. 2020 put the racial inequalities in the United States on full display. It showed that the United States healthcare system is completely broken. While 2020 was an incredibly challenging year, I am hopeful that we can learn from what it exposed and work to make a more just and balanced society.\n\nPersonally, 2020 was a difficult year because it made me more internally focused. In many ways I am an introvert. Being around a lot of people can be draining. I value my alone time and having quiet time. But because my natural tendency is to be introverted, 2020 pushed me further in that direction. I felt my energy drained being on large zoom calls with friends. I found it difficult to be on work calls for a lot of the day. But pushing me more internal actually was really difficult. Even though I have introverted tendencies I find the most meaning when I am able to connect with others. 2020 was not easier because I am introverted, it was harder because it pushed me more out of balance.\n\nI will return and expand upon this idea of balance in a little bit below. Having a more internal focus led to me doing more reading in 2020 than I ever have before. I also did more writing and work on this website. While I am proud of all of that work, I want to push myself towards spending more time with others and connecting more with others.\n\nThe previous two years I have done a year in review by looking back at the books I read. I found all of my favorite quotes and compiled them into one piece. Writing that review was an opportunity to bring together the common threads of my year into one place. I was able to identify trends in my thinking that I was not previously noticing. This year, I have already written summaries of my notes on all the books I read and what thoughts they elicited in me. I went through those notes and picked out a few different topics that occurred a couple of times.\n\n*  [This page](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/medium\/book)  contains links to my notes for the 37 books that I read in 2020.\n","\n\nI reflected a number of times on trauma and history. A number of pieces I read looked at how our individual histories keep impacting us and coming back to affect us. Even if events happened a long time ago, they are still impacting how we think and move through the world. I choose to use the word **trauma** because we have a more solid framework around it. We understand that traumatic experiences can still affect our emotions. But I want to expand the scope of how we think about what trauma is and the impact of our personal histories.\n\nOur history is something that is constantly impacting us. Whenever we make decisions or act in certain ways, we are calling on our history of experiences to help us. That history can be helpful but it can also be harmful. When we face an experience, we use similar historical experiences to guide us. This can happen both consciously but also unconsciously. If those historical experiences are still relevant, that can be a useful exercise. But we also can bring the baggage from our previous experiences and it can blind us to what is actually in front of us. We might feel more insecure in our current romantic relationship because of other previous relationships.\n\nThe most difficult part to understand the impact of our history is that we are not always conscious of the ways it is impacting us. In our head we might have a narrative about why we are making a decision, but that narrative can miss the impact of our history. It takes an active effort to recognize that we are feeling a certain way because of a historical experience. Once we recognize this, we can then ask ourselves is this feeling valid or actually detrimental.\n","\nBefore this year, I was all in on the idea of growth mindset. I was constantly thinking about the ways that I wanted to improve myself. But this year has forced me to recognize that a growth mindset might not be sustainable. That type of focus will not lead to long term happiness and peace. By focusing on the ways I wanted to grow, I am also subtly critiquing the person that I am today. I also never had a fixed target of where I wanted to be. How much growth was enough? I could make progress on some things but then still want to make even more.\n\nInstead of focusing on growth, I am looking for **balance**. Balance is not a passive resting place though. Balance is a constant moving target. Everyday there are external forces pushing us in different directions. Those forces could come from your work, from what you read, from other people\u2019s opinions. Balance inherently understands that we will never be finished. We have to accurately understand where we are today and adjust accordingly. Some days we might be off balance in one direction and other days we will be off balance in the opposite direction.\n","\n\nOur strengths and our weaknesses are tightly intertwined. This year helped me understand that I do not have certain things I am strong at and certain things I am weak at. The things I am weak at are directly related to the things that I am strong at. Strengths cannot exist without weaknesses also existing. This understanding allows for a deeper picture in thinking about my own identity and makes it easier to accept my own weaknesses.\nRelated to the idea of balance, I am not going to be able to just remove weaknesses and add strengths. When I have a strength, I also have a weakness that is connected to that same trait. Understanding this gives me a fuller picture. What I had previously framed as a weakness is actually connected to something that I view as a strength. This allows me to better understand where that weakness comes from and how to work with it rather than try to get rid of it.\n","\nThe people that I surround myself with is one of the largest determinants of my direction. In the balance section I mentioned how there are external forces that influence us. One of the largest ones is the people that I am interacting with regularly.\n\nWhile individual relationships are important, this year has made me reflect on how community can be even more powerful. A community is larger than just individual interactions with different people. Community shows the power of a group of people coming together united about something. The communities principles or mission become larger than anyone one person.\n\nOne of the most difficult parts of 2020 has been how it is harder to have community.\n","\n\nIt is easy to forgot how hard it is to truly know what is going on with someone else. Many of the books I read touched on both the difficulty of understanding others and how others might have difficulty understanding you. We have such a deep relationship with our own thoughts and identity. We do not come anywhere near having such an intimate relationship with others as we do with our own thoughts. This asymmetry can make it difficult to recognize others for who they really are. We build stories about others and make assumptions about what they are thinking.\n\nIt requires constant effort to try and understand someone else. We should not expect others to understand us unless we communicate with them and we must provide others with the space to communicate about themselves with us. This requires having different standards and expectations for ourselves then we have with others. I want to push myself to communicate what is going on with myself as much as possible while also expecting that others will not necessarily share themselves unless I provide the space for them.\n","\nAfter this year I recognize the importance of having more distance from my work. Before this year I probably would have said that my ideal schedule would be working about 5 hours everyday rather than having a weekend. After this year I think it is really important to have long stretches of time where I am not thinking about work at all.\n\nThere were many nights this year were I lay awake not being able to fall asleep thinking about work. I was thinking about how to solve some problem or what I had to get done the next day. I was unable to quiet my mind and get the distance from work that I needed. When I was able to get away from work this year, it was such a respite. When I took a few weeks off it felt like such a weight off my shoulders. But even when I took a few weeks off, it took about a week before I really felt like I had distance from work. When I spend so much of my time working, it can be really difficult to get away. It is not about just not working, but also having ample time for work to feel like it was not recent.\n"],"filename":"2020_in_review"},{"created":1673258647986,"modified":1677662000730,"title":"2021 in Review","status":"Finished","tags":["whoami"],"blocks":["Introduction","Community and Friendships","Phase Transition","Goals"],"blocks_text":["\n\nThe beginning of 2022 feels a lot like the beginning of 2021. I am in Baton Rouge spending quality time with Jenny\u2019s family. We are mostly staying together since Covid is on the rise again. But while my current physical situation is similar to that of last year, 2021 was a much different year from 2020. One of my big focuses for 2021 was spending more time outward facing.\n","\nDuring 2020, I spent most of my time in Baton Rouge with Jenny\u2019s family. While the first year of covid passed safely, I struggled with how far away I felt from friendship and community at times. There are a few different places I put in effort in 2021 that have been really rewarding.\n\n* I started a book club with my friend  [Madison](https:\/\/www.thegirlandthelamb.com\/) . This book club has been so rewarding. It has been a way to connect with some of my friends and to read different things then I am used to. It has challenged me to think deeply about books in a different way. Because of book club I feel less pull to writing  [book notes](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/medium\/book) . Since I am reflecting on these books with others, it satisfies the same itch. Book club has been so much fun because it both has strengthened my relationships with the people in the book club as individuals as well as forming a community that I feel like I am a part of.\n\n* Jenny and I moved to Cambridge, MA this year because she started her PHD at MIT. Moving to a new city meant that we are now far away from a lot of the friends we have previously made. This meant we had to work at making new friends and forming connections. After a little less that half a year in Boston, it feels like we have made some really good friends that I am excited to continue spending time with. I love connecting with new people. The beginning of a relationship contains so much learning and understanding about fundamental aspects of another person.\n\n* Since I graduated from college a few years ago, I have been struggling with what a friendship looks like. Until I graduated college most of my friends were people that I saw on a regular basis. They were people who lived in the same place as me and did the same things as me. But as my friends started to spread out and pursue their own directions that meant a lot of the people who I cared about live far away. This year I have finally started to feel secure and comfortable in what friendship looks like when I live far away from others. Jenny and I spent a lot of our summer visiting friends and it was great to reconnect with people I have not seen in a while.\n\n* After moving to Boston I started volunteering tutoring math at a local public school. Volunteering is something that I have really wanted to do more of and I am glad that I have found a way to do that through  [Boston Partners in Education](https:\/\/bostonpartners.org\/) . Working remotely it is easy to not be as attached to my immediate local surroundings. Volunteering is a great way for me to meet and learn from people who I otherwise would not interact with on a daily basis.\n\n* Jenny and I have gotten really into practicing Ashtanga Yoga. Slowly over the past few years I had been doing more and more Yoga. Most of that was following YouTube videos. In Boston, Jenny found a yoga studio that we really like and a teacher who teaches Ashtanga. Ashtanga is a little bit different than some other main stream yoga. It is the same practice every time. Ashtanga is really challenging but it feels good to work hard at something with a community of other people and slowly make progress on it. I really enjoy all the other people who have been practicing with us and the weekly ritual of going to yoga class.\n\nAll of these changes in the past year have made me feel a lot happier and secure socially on a day to day basis. Working remote means that I am not seeing people face to face as much and so it is really important for me to have the right social outlets that bring connection and fulfillment.\n","\nThe past few months have felt a little bit like a phase transition in Jenny and my life. The past three years since we graduated from college have been one section in our lives and we are transitioning to the next one. The past section involved Jenny and me understanding our relationship better and what it will look like going forward. It was about us learning how to take care of ourselves and how to live a healthy life. We were able to explore living in a few different places and working at a few different jobs to get a better understanding of what things are most important to us.\n\nNow that Jenny has started her PHD, we are going to be living in Boston for the next few years. While we still have much to learn and change, it feels like we have built a really solid foundation. We have learned a lot about ourselves, what we are passionate about and how we want to move through the world.\nNow that we have these building blocks in place, it feels like both of us can start being ambitious in some other areas. Jenny is exploring what it means to do economic research and complete a PHD. I feel very solid in my career at Whisper and am excited about the work I am going to continue doing there. I have learned how to balance my work life with some pursuits outside of work and the importance of having those other pursuits.\n\nUsing this base, I have some goals that I want to pursue in 2022. These goals are ambitious so I would not be surprised if I do not meet all of them, but I am excited about being ambitious with them.\n","\n\n* My main project outside of work is going to be  [Repeated Generator](https:\/\/repeatedgenerator.netlify.app\/) . I am exploring how I can improve my own writing practice and idea generation process.\n* For the past couple of years I have flirted with reading textbooks. I never found a good method to read textbooks and maintain the knowledge I was reading. Towards the end of the year I started using Spaced Repetition and I think that holds promise for making reading textbooks more rewarding. I have a couple of textbook reading groups I am trying to be in this year.\n* This is the year I finally get my drivers license. During the holidays I have been doing some driving in Baton Rouge and should be able to get my license later this year in Boston.\n* By the time I am 30, I want to make some serious progress on learning Chinese. I do not know what serious progress means, but it feels like this year I should at least start developing a plan for learning chinese.\n* I spent some time in 2021 thinking about  [career funding](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/diversity_in_funding_models) , the  [long term future of my career](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/a_different_funding_model) , and what  [organization](https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/substack_limitations_and_dao_possibilities)  I want to be a part of.

I wanted to put some additional words down about why Microcommons feels important to me at a personal level. I am going to start by doing a writing exercise I have done before every career change: making an itemized list of what I want in my next opportunity.\n\n","\n\n1. I want to work on an incredibly ambitious project. If the project is successful it will create a large positive impact for many people. The potential of this large impact will be a lasting source of motivation for me. In my previous jobs, I often have had to force myself to do work because I do not feel motivated by the project. Coercing myself to do something that I do not want to feels unhealthy. Of course, there will always be aspects of a projects that I am not excited about. But, using the long term goal of the project as the motivation makes it much easier to do those difficult tasks. I believe that a healthier relationship with my work would come from this type of motivation rather than self coercion. \n\n2.  The vast majority of my time should be spent on the core project. In previous organizations,  so much energy has been devoted to capturing the value that a project creates. Energy is directed away from making a better product and towards growth.  Finding sources of revenue to keep the organization running is important, but it often becomes too large of a focus, drowning out the original aims of the organization.  Similarly, organizations often view growth as a sign of success, growing the size of organization. This leads to lots of energy being spent on coordination in meetings.  While some meetings are important, most meetings are a suck on my energy, preventing me from doing deep work.  Ideally I am spending large chunks of time everyday doing deep work pushing the core project forward.\n\n3. My co-workers should be respectful, kind, joyful and generous. The most unpleasant part of previous experiences has been co-workers who are rude, abrasive and not open to other\u2019s ideas.  I have had coworkers like this at every previous job. It is so demoralizing to work with people like that. \n\t\n4. The project should that push my skill set in a new direction. There are such immense returns in your work output from growing your skill set \/ ability. I both want to become better at the things I am already good at, and try my hand at things which I have not done before.\n\n5. I should be following a path that is different from those who are similar to me. If I do similar things to what others around me are doing, I will probably have similar outcomes.  Trying an unconventional path makes me more likely to discover a way to have a much more positive outcome. I personally am most inspired by people who are brave, following their own unique direction. I should try to follow a similar direction as the people who inspire me the most.  \n\n","\nWhile I believe there are other opportunities that satisfy my requirements, I am particularly excited about what Microcommons could be. It is a first step in re-envisioning the role of *work* in our lives. \n\nSince transitioning from a student to a worker in 2018, I have heard from many peers about work situations which cause them a lot of unhappiness.  They describe experiences where they are treated poorly, do not feel seen and work long hours on uninspiring projects. Since work is the environment that we spend the plurality of our time, these unhappy situations have a large impact on their lives. The suffering that happens at work bleeds over into the rest of their lives, draining their energy and creating a habit of avoidance. Having a better work situation not only impacts that chunk of time, but also has positive impacts on the rest of your life.\n\nTo create better work situations for a large number of people, we need new institutions with different perspectives on work.  While it is currently possible for individuals  to create opportunities that work for themselves, to enact change on a larger scale we need to build communities. An institution \/ community provides validation that a career decision is wise. It is much easier to follow in the foot steps of others than doing something on your own. Most of the jobs where I hear about my peers suffering are ones that where seen as desirable in college. Going to work at these institutions was a straight forward decision though, because many people before them had made the same decision.\n\nFor me, Microcommons is motivated by wanting to create a new structure that encourages people to fully engage their entire selves in a project they find meaningful. Work has the opportunity to be somewhere that people find immense meaning and growth.  Microcommons current structure is Holly and my proposal for creating an environment to build a meaningful project with all of ourselves. I am sure that as we start working on Microcommons we will  need to iterate on what works and what does not. \n\nLong term, I am incredibly excited about the possibility of extending the Microcommons structure to others. I believe Microcommons could be an institution which creates work opportunities which are deeply fulfilling. \n\n","\n\nThere are five important ways Microcommons re-imagines what work could be. None of these are necessarily unique or exclusive to Microcommons, but I believe that combining all of them will create outcomes that are drastically better than what is available today.\n\n1. In our work environment, we should be accountable to a group of peers whom we respect rather than a wealthy individual. Whether it is a non-profit or a for profit company, most work institutions are created by an individual or group of individuals who already have an immense amount of wealth. This group uses their wealth to incentive work on their project. Microcommons in contrast, involves a modest size group of people putting a relatively small portion of their wealth towards funding a small team.  A Microcommons community is not a monolith where everyone is a cog in the machine. It is a smaller group where each steward has real influence. \n\n2. Microcommons creates additional work communities where stewards have the opportunity to contribute and are valued. For most workers, all of their work hours are committed to one community. They spend 40+ hours a week  in the same space with the same people.  I have found that this makes it easy for my identity and sense of self to be very closely tied with this one environment. Microcommons offers an opportunity to be a part of more than just one community. I have personally found that being a part of other environments  besides my main work place is a big boost to my health. Whether it is advising other companies, or volunteering in my community,  more diversity in how I spend my time  has been really meaningful. \n\n3.  Creators in  Microcommons projects have picked a direction that it is well suited to them. Creators will go through a process to explore many different projects. At the end they will select one that is a good match for them. While people currently do put effort into finding work situations that are good matches, Microcommons does this at a more fundamental level. Creators are not constrained by what companies have already been started.  Holly and I went through a multi month phase of exploring different projects areas to determine that Glyph felt right for us.\n\n4. Microcommons believes that small teams over a long time horizon can accomplish an immense amount. Most work institutions grow very large as their ambitions grow. They hire more people believing more people will allow them to do more. While there is logic in this and it is important to have some large institutions, Microcommons wants to create opportunities for small teams to do a lot. Working on a smaller team means less coordination. The team should  be made of personal  that know they work well together and will compliment each other. By committing to a project over a long time horizon the team can be quite ambitious in what they hope to accomplish.\n\n5. Microcommons pushes creators to be continually re-investing in their own growth. Becoming a better worker has such huge returns over an individuals career that it does not make sense how little we invest at getting better at our jobs. Microcommons ensures creators have dedicated time for growing and exploring. \n\nI believe that some of the changes described above are critical for turning work into a space where people find meaning and purpose. Microcommons is only one experiment in re-envisioning what work could be. There are undoudbtely other structures that could also transform the role of work in people\u2019s lives. \n","\nBuilding Microcommons to improve the relationship many of us have with work  is incredibly motivating to me. As I have been reflecting on my next career steps, there are other directions that have also been appealing. Below is a list of some other directions that I have considered, ordered from most conventional \/ safe to most uncommon \/  risky.\n\n* Applying to grad school or doing AI safety research\n* Using my technology skills to find a job working in the biology space\n* Training to be a yoga \/ meditation teacher \n* Working in local government. We already know many policies that could have profoundly positive impacts on many. It is less a question of discovering those policies and more about mobilizing the resources to make it happen.\n* Directly working with low income communities in some way. Not trying to build a new organization but joining an organization that is working to make our society more equitable, specifically targeting inequities due to race. \n\nIn terms of safety \/ commonness, Microcommons sits in between number 2 and 3 on that list.  Building Microcommons leverages a lot of the skills I use in my current roles. It also involves interacting with people who are similar to the ones I already interact with. I feel confident that building Microcommons is a better path than the things above it on the list. I am less confident that Microcommons is a better use of my energy than the things below it on the list.\n"],"filename":"why_microcommons"},{"created":1668601961981,"modified":1677662124225,"title":"Identifying the people who have done the most good","status":"Finished","tags":["career_decisions","media_response"],"blocks":["Introduction","The importance of culture shifts","People who might have done the most good"],"blocks_text":["\nI recently listened to this [discussion](https:\/\/clearerthinkingpodcast.com\/episode\/118) between Michael Nielsen and Ajeya Cotra about effective altruism. While effective altruism (EA) is an appealing community \/ framework, I have some aversion to their framework. I have [written](https:\/\/repeatedgenerator.netlify.app\/posts\/week_5_impact_and_proximity\/) previously about that aversion coming to the conclusion: \n\n> For my own career, I want to be doing work that has a positive impact but also work that I am proximate to. Being proximate to the impact gives me a better understanding of the impact that I am having. Understanding that impact will help me be better at the work because I can recalibrate my actions as I learn more about what the impact actually is.\n\nI was excited to listen to their conversation because both Nielsen and Cotra are individuals whose work I admire. \n\nNielsen\u2019s aversion to EA seems to stem from believing that there is much more uncertainty about what will cause good. He repeatedly comments about how the the people he admires the most and who he thinks have done incredible good are scientists who were not directly trying to do \u201cthe most good\u201c they could. These scientists were often doing work which was not legible to others and potentially they did not even fully understood how meaningful their work would be.  EA does not advocate support for these types of projects. EA is instead a very community that argues for one particular way of spending your time. Nielsen argues that since there is so much uncertainty in what might be good, this centralization is harmful. Instead individuals should be encouraged to think critically about their careers to find what makes the most self for them.\n\nNielsen\u2019s criticism of the centralization of EA, feels related to my thoughts on proximity. In a centralized framework, there is one person  (or group) making the decision for what everyone should do. This means all individuals, no matter where they start, have to move towards that recommendation. It is not  conducive to individuals looking for what type of work is uniquely situated for them.  While I believe individual EA\u2019s would give you the advice to think critically about your own path, and to find a unique continuation of that path which makes sense, the community as a whole does push slightly different values.\n\nComing away from their conversation, I  have a stronger appreciation for how EA forces individuals to think critically about their careers and their life. While I still have aversion to the certainty with which EA operates and therefore some of the tenets of how, encountering EA has made me think more critically about my life decisions. \n","\nThere was one part of their conversation which I have been returning. They started discussing the following question for a brief period of time: \n\n> Who are the people that have done the most good? Where has the most good come from?\n\nI was surprised that both Nielsen and Ajeya struggled to answer this question so much. I was especially surprised that Ajeya struggled since she is someone so immersed in the EA community. EA\u2019s central tenant is trying to understand how to do the most good. A historical evaluation of the different people who have done immense good and how they did that good would be super helpful to answer that question. As far as I know, the EA community has not taken this kind of historical approach though. The community has mostly focused on looking at the situation today and trying to project what will be the most good looking forward. I am sure that the community does a fair amount of including historical perspective into their thinking ([Holden karnofsky does here](https:\/\/www.cold-takes.com\/future-proof-ethics\/)) but it feels like a more in depth and rigorous historical approach would be particularly insightful. \n\nI would absolutely love a historical piece that tries to understand how much good certain historical figures \/ movements caused. What type of role did scientists or corporations or activists or religious figures or artists have. What types of mindsets did the people who did the most good have in common? \n\nWhen I first started thinking about my own answer to this question I jumped to thinking about big cultural shifts that have occurred. During my parents lifetime, there have been some huge cultural shifts which I have caused a lot of good. Things like:\n* \tA large drop in violent crime\n* A large drop in the number of people who smoke cigarettes\n* Many more people thinking about exercise and their diet\n* People becoming vegetarian\n\nI have previously [written](https:\/\/repeatedgenerator.netlify.app\/posts\/week_7_public_opinion_changes\/) about why I believe their is an importance in studying the impact of public opinion changing:\n\n> Some types of changes to our society are predicated on large scale public opinion changes. Without people changing their opinions we are not going to have a more equal distribution of wealth or a more sustainable relationship with the environment. There are instances in history where there has been large changes in public opinion. But also some instances where the change has taken a really long time or maybe still has not happened. Understanding public opinion and how it moves feels under studied. It is a complex topic that does not fit neatly into one of our existing **academic fields**.\n\nIf I believe that immense good has come from shifts in public opinion, then some of the people who have done the most good are those that have contributed to those shifts. Public figures, like artists and novelists who created mass media that helped build a movement to slowly change people\u2019s minds.\n\nThis uncovers another way for me to be thinking about doing good.  I should looking for some possible large scale public opinion changes that could create a much better society. A couple of ones that job out are: \n- a very different view of money and what living a successful live is\n- a very different view of mental health\n- a very different view of our relationship to animals\n- a very different view of our relationship to strangers. \n\n","\nQuick list of people who I believe have probably done a lot of good that do not have EA mindset: \n- Sharon Salzberg, Joseph Goldstein or Jack Kornfield\n- Michael Pollen, Sam Harris or Ezra Klein\n- Barack and Michelle Obama\n- Stewart Brand, Rachel Carson\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"filename":"identifying_the_people_who_have_done_the_most_good"},{"created":1651235365102,"modified":1677663585428,"title":"Assorted Meditation Thoughts","status":"Finished","tags":["meditation"],"blocks":[],"blocks_text":["\n- Reading is as a form of meditation. There is an object of focus that I keep trying to bring my attention back to. I am able to notice when my mind is wandering because I am not focused on the text. I notice in general that I am a bit happier and more balanced when I am reading books on my kindle with some regularity.\n\t\n* I have some difficulties with using the term \u201cthe path\u201c to talk about meditation practice. While having some notion of advancement is helpful, it can also be detrimental at times. I am more drawn to metaphors that focus on finding balance. \n\n* There is something powerful about setting intentions. In one framing meditation is simply setting an intention for a period of time. I set the intention to focus on my breath and then just relax. That intention then has an impact on what happens during the next period. We can\u2019t force ourselves to focus on the breath, we just set the intention and then it will happen naturally. \n\n* I struggle a lot with uncomfortable physical sensations during meditation. The uncomfortableness is never static. It is constantly slightly changing in intensity, location and feeling. If the sensation were constant, it would be easier to adapt to it. I would get used to it. It is so hard to let go of the unpleasantness because it is constantly changing. The constant changing is what allows it to hold my attention so tightly. \n\n- A common concern I hear from people is that meditation might make them apathetic. That if we are happy or able to find joy regardless of condition, then we will not try to change anything. From my own experience, meditation does not have this impact at all. We are so programmed around striving and attainment that meditation attempts to balance that out just a little bit. It comes nowhere near to making me apathetic. There might be some extreme cases where this could happen, but I think its not really a practical concern for most people.\n\n- Meditation retreats involve a different way of being with others that can be quite jarring at first. It feels like retreats should briefly discuss this different way of being in the presence of others. During my first retreats I struggled with this a lot. It can feel neglecting to experience being in the presence of so many others but not interacting with them in a way that I am used to. \n\n- Meditating with body scans be quite intense. When I start trying to get deeply in touch with what my body is feeling, the sheer number of sensations is overwhelming. The amount of input that our bodies are constantly processing is so high! We are constantly sampling it down and filtering an immense amount of it. Most of the inputs that our body is taken in we are not consciously paying attention to. This means we are always experiencing a filtered view of our experience.\n\n- A big advancement in my practice has been moving from having a more active role to a less active role. The other way I think about this, is moving from focusing to releasing. If my mind wanders, I should relax \/ release into the breath rather than focus on the breath. So rather than seeing it as wander, focus, wander, focus, it could be float, release, float, release "],"filename":"assorted_meditation_thoughts"},{"created":1677176105636,"modified":1677664607133,"title":"AI generated article","status":"In Progress","tags":["sparks"],"blocks":[],"blocks_text":["\n\nThere has beens this idea that you can have an AI generated article.

Image generation models like DALLE, Midjourney and Stable Diffusions have given people a test for using AI assisted tooling. Other creators are figuring out how to incorporate interactions with GPT-3 into our workflows. There has been excitement about using AI assisted tools to help with the coding process. An example of this is Github\u2019s copilot which can currently be used to generate code. While we believe using AI to help with the coding process is a really promising direction, I believe that we are not quite there yet. This is something I will be excited to explore, but at a fundamental level think its not quite suited to this context yet.\n\nThe current models are not well suited yet to coding because we have not developed the necessary primitives to facilitate good back and forth collaboration between the human and the machine. For the current models, the way you interact with them is through text. The use cases where it has worked the best are ones where getting the details right does not matter. For a lot of the image generation examples it was fine if some of the details were off. The models are not as good when you need things to be quite specific.\n\nIn creating applications users need the ability to have a lot of fine grained control. To easily move things around. The best interfaces for interacting with AI are going to involve back and forth workflows. The user puts in inputs, suggestions are made and then those suggestions can be edited or adjusted. Which our current interface of text files, that process is not the best one. When Co-pilot generates code it is not immediately clear if we the code it generated is correct. It is also still difficult to know how to edit that code to make it correct\n\n- A different shared representation than current coding languages. Structure makes it easy to communicate. What we are communicating about it a subset of what all language is needed. Notation is more domain specific.  It depends how constrained you want the user to be.

Inspired by the example from hip-hop collectives. There are a bunch of creators or groups of creators working on their own individual projects. There is then a collective of groups that are all affiliated with each other. They each have their own projects, but they help each other out with their projects as well. \n\n","\nFor musical artists they have a bunch of different projects.

This happens both consciously and in a deeply internalized way. There are absolutely times when I am consciously aware that certain actions will improve how others perceive me. The more subtle instances are when I have crafted a story around why X is important to me. But really X is important to me because it is important to others. Doing well in school was deeply internalized as one of my values, because I was consistently shown that others admired people who did well in school. \n\nMy desire to spend my energy on projects that will have a [large impact](https:\/\/repeatedgenerator.netlify.app\/posts\/week_5_impact_and_proximity\/) is partially driven by wanting approval. Society valorizes individuals who have large impacts. We are taught about the great women and men of history. The brilliant activists, policy makers, scientists and artists. I was consistently messaged that one way for my existence to be valuable is to achieve something that society will admire. \n\nMy initial reaction to recognizing this desire is to question how healthy it is. Doing something solely for others approval can be dangerous. I have found that when I am too focused on winning someone\u2019s approval, I often hurt someone else. I am fixating on success in such a narrow way, that I cause harm. This desire for approval from others is not necessarily bad. Caring about others opinions\u2019 is an important aspect of how humans build community. It allows us to develop a set of commonly accepted behavior. I am not making every decision from a blank slate but can rely on commonly accepted wisdom that has been built across many people and generations. \n\n","\n\nWhen investigating my desire to be approved by others, it is critical to ask who are the others. There are some others whose opinion I care more about and some others whose opinions I probably do not care that much about. I am most concerned with the approval of the people I spend time around. Since I spent so much of my time in an academic environment I want approval from people who also attended expensive educational institutions or who work in higher paying tech \/ academic jobs. \n\nSince these opinions are the ones that currently motivate me, I am attracted to working in fields that are less developed. This motivation means that I have a lot of energy \/ excitement when thinking about projects in less developed fields. When I was doing academic research on machine intelligence I was so energized everyday. That energy derived from feeling like there was a chance that I could actually make a meaningful contribution. It is easier to make a contribution in areas that are less developed for the following reasons.\n\t* Often there is less background knowledge and years of studying that is needed to get to the cutting edge of the field \n\t* The methods for doing research are less defined and having a unique approach can be really important \n\t* The rate of progress in the field is quite rapid\n\nDue to this interest of working in newer \/ less explored fields the topics I am currently most interested in are:\n\t* Understanding intelligence (neuroscience, biological systems, synthetic biology, machine learning) \n\t* Designing collective organizations (organizational structure and blockchain governance)\n\t* Tools for creation (quantum Computation and creativity tools) \n\n---\nIn the past month or so, my friend Holly and I did some background reading on quantum computation to understand if we would be interested working on problems in that space. The goal was to understand the current state of the field and identify what problems are the most promising to work on. We decided to not continue exploring this space for now because it feels like quantum computation is still relatively far away and the projects in this space do not seem like a good fit for us.\n\nSome quick synthesis from our reading:\n\t* Building quantum computers is really hard. Manipulating qubits without errors is really difficult. People have come up with strategies for handling errors , but they require many additional qubits. This means usable quantum computers are still relatively far away. That being said, cloud computing should make quantum computers more accessible with a  quicker adoption rate than the beginning of classical computers. \n\t* Quantum computation is often taught by comparing it to classical computation. A good teaching technique is to use knowledge people already have, but I think this approach is actually harmful for quantum computation. The use cases for quantum computers are so different than the use cases for classical computers. Many sources focused on how we can do everything with a quantum computer that you can do with  a classical computer. While the proof for this is true, I feel like it leads people astray. Quantum computers have different strengths and different use cases from classical computers. We should not message them as more universal computers. \n\t* Quantum computation does have the potential to do some really interesting tasks. Using qubits we are able to simulate systems in a way that is essentially impossible with classical computing.  The first meaningful use cases of quantum computation will involve simulating real world systems. If I were going to keep spending time focusing on quantum computation, I would try to understand these use cases. These use cases are less reliant on a large number of qubits and a much more natural fit for quantum computers. Here are the papers I identified that touch on this idea\n\t\t* [Simulating Physics with Computers ](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007\/BF02650179.pdf) \n\t\t*  [Simulating Chemistry](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1007.2648) \n\t\t*  [Simulating Quantum Dynamics](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1011.3489) \n\t\t*  [Reaction mechanisms](https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/epdf\/10.1073\/pnas.1619152114) \n\t\t*  [Solving correlated electron models](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1506.05135.pdf) \n\t\t*  [Quantum for chemsity](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1706.05413.pdf) \n\n\t* I think we will be surprised by the ways quantum computers are used.

I have not seen this type of meditation documented before so I want to briefly describe it. It might fall into the category of  body scan meditation. I started developing this meditation after a conversation with my friend [Stephen](https:\/\/twitter.com\/zerfas33?lang=en) where he pointed me to this twitter thread by [Nick Cammarata](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nickcammarata\/status\/1596206840324292608). \n\nWe were discussing how we can notice a certain amount of tension at the top of our heads at all times. This tension is most noticeable when I feel overwhelmed. When I am particularly tired or stress there can be an intense pressure concentrated towards the front of my head. While it is not a perfect relationship, there is a connection between my mental state \/ spaciousness in a given moment and the amount of tension I feel in my head. \n\nIn both yoga and meditation teachers often cue letting go of tension in your shoulders. Whenever a teacher gives this cue, I struggle to feel like I have meaningfully reduced the amount of tension in my shoulders.  By directing my attention to the tension it would actually increase the amount of tension that I felt. Similarly, I struggle to directly release the tension in my head. Putting my attention there can increase the amount of tension I feel.  \n\nNick\u2019s thread suggests that rather than going directly to where I feel tension, I should try to release tension in other parts of my body. I had not thought of this approach, but it mirrors what I have learned about how to recover when I have an injured muscle. When I pull a muscle, the worst thing is to work on that muscle directly. If my hamstring is injured, the best thing I can do is work on the nearby muscles, but not the hamstring directly. This approach also opens up the number of different actions possible to me . Rather than just not working on my hamstring and waiting, I can actually help the process along by working on other places. It gives me more agency when I feel like there is a blockage.\n\nThis pattern of not directly confronting the difficult area, but first focusing on nearby areas might also apply to emotional difficulties. When I am upset or frustrated, often thinking about the source of my difficulty only makes it work. It probably is more fruitful to get some distance from that difficulty, work on other areas, and then when my whole system is in a slightly better state, return to the difficulty.\n\n","\nThis meditation is focused on releasing tension that I am storing in my body. I particularly like doing this meditation towards the end of the day as a wind down. Here the steps that I follow:\n\n1. It is good to first cultivate some stillness before going straight into this practice. I do this by spending a few moments focusing on the breadth and then sitting in Jhana 2 for a little bit. This first step is important because going directly into a body related practice is quite difficult. For any body related practice it is important to have reached some amount of stillness.  \n2. I begin by noticing the amount of tension I am storing in my head. I normally look at the top front of my head. Not quite my forehead but somewhere slightly further back and up. \n3. Rather than directly letting go of this tension, I focus on letting go of tension in my Jaw. I picked the jaw, because it is somewhere that will always have some tension, but is also easier to release. I am starting here to help remind myself what it feels like to realize tension. When I release tension, I sync up the release with my out breath. The release often involves some amount of pushing the tension. The tension is not magically disappearing but it is being displaced and thereby dispersed. With my jaw I displace the tension in a downward direction.\n4. After releasing some tension in my jaw I release tension in the back of my head.  I follow a similar process there as with my jaw, but I displace the tension out the back of my head rather than down. For these steps it is important to cultivate the sensational cue of releasing tension. I am working to find the emotional experience of relax.\n5. I then move to my hands releasing tension in each of my fingers spending about five seconds per finger. Releasing tension in the finger will cause a slight twitch. After completing each finger I try to release tension across the entire hand. I then release the entire hand, before moving on the other hand.  \n6. I then do the same process again, but slow down the tension release in each finger. I now will spend twenty seconds on each finger releasing the tension more slowly.\n7. Working with my fingers is helpful because they are very concentrated with lots of nerves in them. After working with such concentrated areas I try to expand my scope to larger areas. This begins by realizing the entire hand including all of the fingers. While I am not always successful I also try realizing the  forearm, or even the entire arm. \n8. While I am releasing tension in these areas, often areas that have more tension, like my shoulders or head are asking for attention. They are calling out to me that I should try to release them instead. I ignore this to focus on releasing these easier areas with less tension.  \n9. After my hands, I then repeat the same process in my toes and feet. Generally my toes and feet are harder to realize than my hands and fingers. \n10. I then pause for a moment and allow my body to surface places where I am holding tension. Almost always the place where I am holding tension is my shoulder and neck area. Occasionally it is my left knee. I then direct my attention to that area. Instead of  trying to release the place that has the most tension I release small adjacent areas. I then slowly move towards the areas that has the most intense tension. After that I try to release tension in bigger areas all at the same time.\n11. After doing this for the most intense locations, eventually it becomes apparent that I have a fair amount of tension in my head. I then direct my attention to my head and start trying to release tension there. As I am releasing the tension in my head I am pushing it backwards and down. When I am most successful I am able to relocate almost all of the tension to the lower back section of my head and then from there I push it out of my body.\n12. I will then cycle between focusing on my head and focusing somewhere in my body. It can be really hard to feel like I have fully released the tension in my head so I try not to fixate too much energy on achieving a perfect release there.\n13. The steady state of this meditation is just observing the body, allowing tension to arise and then trying to release it. It also becomes quite powerful to be able to release tension in large areas all at the same time.\n","\nThis practice has been so helpful to me because it decreases the amount of physical discomfort I experience. After completing the practice my body feels loose and pliable. My mental state will also have improved becoming quite calm.\n\nIt is also possible that this meditation helps improve my bodies self regulatory systems. This practice trains our system to notice when tension is arising and then relax that tension away. If we practice doing this consciously it may become something we eventually do unconsciously. Our system will then be one which does not let unnoticed tension build up in the body. \n\n\n\n\n\n"],"filename":"tension_release_meditation"},{"created":1676464453223,"modified":1679572024638,"title":"R &D Collective principals","status":"In Progress","tags":["organization_structure"],"blocks":["Project principles ","Working with community principles ","Multiple Levels of Abstraction"],"blocks_text":["\n\n- Things are tied to a product\n- \n\n\n","\n\n\n",""],"filename":"r_&d_collective_principals"},{"created":1679310085415,"modified":1679655584714,"title":"Meditation Journal - Product Spec","status":"In Progress","tags":["products","meditation"],"blocks":["Details","Reflection Template"],"blocks_text":["\n- A way to keep track of your meditation process and make sure you are learning and adjusting.\n- lets you log meditations and information about them\n- lets you look back at previous meditations\n\t- could have a timeline that you can zoom in and out of\n- asks you to regular condense the information you have learned by looking back at meditations\n\t- weekly\n\t- monthly \n\t- yearly\n- some possible extensions\n\t- has a library with different practices\n\n- has an entry form at the beginning \n\t* let me make a template for this \n* had regular reflections \n\t* these are compressions of recent practices \n* \n","\n\n**End Time:**\n**Duration:** \n**Context:**\n**Practice Style:** \n**Posture:** \n**Physical Body Discomfort:** \n**Main Distractions:**\n* \n**Description:**\n* \n **Learnings:**\n* \n\n","\nThere are basically three stages \n* introduction to meditation \n\t* developing a consistent practice \n\t* Exploring different types of practices \n* jhanas \n* Liberating insight \n\nWe could host retreats that aim to take you from beginning to first jhana in a week \n\nIntegration and relationships are important to weave into practice.

The Suttas say with the abandonment of the five hindrances the Jhanas naturally arise. Since I believe the Jhanas are an incredibly useful tool, working with the five hindrances is an important skill. \n\n I have seen the five hindrances most commonly described as: \n\t1. Desire\n\t2. Aversion \/ Avoidance\n\t3. Laziness \/ Lethargy\n\t4. Agitation from worry\n\t5. Doubt\n\nIn  [Leigh Brasington\u2019s piece](http:\/\/rc.leighb.com\/more\/Abandoning_the_Five_Hindrances.htm) on working with the five hindrances he helpfully simplifies them to: \n\t1. Wanting \n\t2. Not Wanting\n\t3. Too little energy\n\t4. Too much energy\n\t5. Doubt\n\nOne method of working with the hindrances is noting. Nothing is the process of calmly naming something when you notice its presence. While  meditating, when I notice my mind has drifted away from the meditation object I briefly label where my mind has gone with a hindrance  If I am thinking about what I want to eat for dinner, I calmly note \u201cdesire\u201c and return to the meditation object. \n\nWhile trying this noting technique, I often struggled to pick a label that felt accurate. After recognizing that I had drifted, it was not easy to map my thoughts to one of the categories. Sometimes a thought felt like it could be in multiple categories or it felt like no category correctly applied. This meant that whenever I would try to label a thought, I would get caught up in more thinking.\n","\nI have a deep appreciation for how the buddha din not force his teachings on students through blind faith. He asked that each student should try his methods out and then determine if his teachings have merits. Trying the teaching out rather than rejecting it from logical reasoning helps me have a more balanced perspective. Rather than flat out dismissing it, I can identify the parts that I connect with and drop the parts that I do not. I undergo a process of integration where I match the teachings to what my experience is. Rather than blindly accepting the teach by making my experience fit into a mold, I try to understand the core elements of the teaching and reframe them to met my experience.\n\nWhile I struggled with the hinderance noting practice as it was initially described, it helped me notice patterns in my thoughts. It was quite clear that a lot of the thoughts I was having were quite similar. I was consistently trying to plan out the upcoming hours and days. I was forcing a schedule on everything in an effort to control my experience. The noting practice helped me understand how there are certain tendencies that my mind naturally drifts towards. \n\n\nI made the noting practice a better fit for myself by creating my own categories rather than using  the traditional five hindrances. I made my categories  by noting the type of thoughts that arose frequently. Over a couple of meditation periods it became clear that almost all of my thoughts could fall into a few categories. The categories my thoughts fall into are listed below. The first categories appear a lot more frequently than the later categories.\n\t1. Planning\n\t2. Social evaluation\n\t3. Achievement \/ acquisition\n\t4. Fixation on non essential details\n\t5. Fear of difference\n\nOnce I started using my own hindrances, the noting practice became a lot more effective. When my mind drifted, I was easily able to label which category it fell into. Returning to the meditation object became smooth rather than a disjointed process of trying to accurately fit my own experience into someone else\u2019s framework.\n\nIntegrating a teaching with my own experience is a core part of the learning process for me. When I first see a new teaching, whether that is about meditation or math it exists in the abstract. For me to really understand the teaching, I need to connect it with experiences that I have. Sometimes this can simply be working with the teaching in concrete examples. Nothing about the teaching needs to change, I just need to connect it with my own understanding. Other times it can be helpful to slightly adjust the teaching, keeping the core learning intact, but modifying the language or peripheries so it fits better with my current context.\n\n"],"filename":"finding_my_own_obstacles"},{"created":1679310301559,"modified":1680773425782,"title":"Response to The Bayesian Brain and Meditation","status":"In Progress","tags":["media_response","meditation","top_of_mind","intelligence"],"blocks":["Notes"],"blocks_text":["\n\n- There are two variables that do not show up in the current model which feel important. These are:  \n\t\t1. **Time**: Currently in the model, an agent is taking in the input in moment and then making a model of the world in that moment. But moments are constantly starting and ending. I imagine we could change the model so an agent is taking in input at time t and then modeling what will happen at time t+1. It is probably even more complicated than that where they are at the same time modeling a bunch of future moments. Predicting forward in time is what forces us to make these complex models. \n\t\t2. **State**: By state I mean it seems like agents have a state that they are in that gets updated. We remember things about our previous experience. These states might just be the weights of our model, but it seems like there is both short term state and long term state. I would be curious to see this formalized. \nThere is actually probably a relationship between these two. State is important because it allows for better estimation over time. While things are likely to change they will not change that quickly and so state helps you predict over time better.\n\nMotivates the model, by the intractable of bales algorithm \u2014> could we motivate it by also having to guess forward in time?\n\n\n- I think examining time and state are interesting because there are avenues that can help us understand how agents system might function differently. For example, we can use these two dimensions to think about how human agents are different than other animal agents.  It is possible that we can draw a distinction between humans and animals not due to \u201cconsciousness\u201c, but how our system handles time and state differently. It seems that our system is different from animals in the following ways:\n\t1.  we are trying to minimize surprise over a longer period of time. This means we have to form a more complex model\n\t2. We are better able to update our model that other animals\n\t\n\n* I am also curious about how we might more directly think about the role of emotions in this model. On the surface, it feels like emotions play a key role in how our system updates itself. Pleasant emotions update our system to move towards something and unpleasant emotions update the system to move away from something. Often when we meditate, it involves putting more distance between ourselves and our emotions. The emotions still arise but they do not become over powering. In this way is meditation, slowing down our update functions. Rather than constantly having to update our system, we know have a more stable system. \n\t* Could emotions kind of be like a label, I mean they are actually reinforcement\n\t* a lot of reinforcement and labeling comes from the other being that we interact with\n\t* our parents and teachers for example\n\n* Another direction I am curious to explore is the role that language plays in our system. This system could exist and did exist before the invention of language. But it seems like the invention of language drastically changed how the system operates. Seeing how the system is different on retreat when we have the noble silence helps show this. Is it possible that the false self is more a construction of language being introduced into the system rather than a construction of the system itself. If we had different methods of communication would the system function differently? Our methods of communication actually create some of these properties rather than the system itself. With different ways of communicating our consciousness would display different properties. But language creates certain properties \n\t* Is the phenomenal self model created because of language\n\t* the need to communicate with others \n\t* maybe its not created, but its re-enforced \n\t* A big part of this is maybe not language but strictly NARRATIVE. That we have to have an ongoing story that makes coherent sense. \n\n* If we are trying to minimize uncertainty why can surprise be the best thing? Let it flow allows for surprise.\n\n- What are the implications for when people have the wrong model? They built a model of a world during certain conditions, but not the model has drifted. Example as transition from school to being in the work force.\n\t- a lot of problems come from the model being formed at a different time\n\t- so how do people update to the new model\n\t- Are there certain aspects of the model it is harder to update\n\t\t- like lower down aspects are harder to update.

Regularly formulating my ideas through writing helps me reach a deeper and more nuanced understanding. Writing particularly helps me identify aspects of my thinking that are fuzzy since I am unable to clearly articulate them. If I am unable to succinctly express my opinion then it highlights a place where I need to do further exploration. Writing helps me extend small sparks of ideas into more coherent pictures. It has been clear to me for a number of years how important this process of discovery is. Having a writing practice is more than finding the correct way to express something that I know. The process of writing is literally where I form my opinions and believes.\n\nWhile having a writing practice has repeatedly shown it\u2019s importance to me, it is still something that I struggle with! I have tried a number of different times to start projects related to writing, with all of them eventually sputtering out. The [first attempt was in 2018](https:\/\/medium.com\/the-fox-and-the-hedgehog\/why-blog-11a7a0c166ef) and had little structure beyond wanting to write regularly. I took other stab at the beginning of 2021 with my [Personal Archive Project](\/personal_archive_project). At the start of 2022, wanting to write more, I came up with the project of [Repeated Generator](\/repeated_generator). Part of this project was understanding the structure of my [Writing Process](\/writing_process) better. While this project was not what I originally envisioned,  in 2022 I wrote more pieces that I was proud of than any previous year by far. Writing so much helped me learn about how to structure my writing practice to get the most out of it. \n\n Now that I have a better understanding of how to structure my writing practice I want to start building some tooling to help facilitate the process. From pushing myself to write more, I learned more about how imposing some structure on my practice can be helpful. I have started imposing some structure on the way that I write and it has really improved my practice. I believe that directly incorporating this structure into my writing tooling will help improve my writing practice. The main enhancements I am looking to achieve from creating my own tooling are:\n\n1. It will help me push more of my writing into a finished state.\n2. It will help me get more value from previous pieces I have written\n3. It will help me finding connections and patterns across multiple pieces I have written.  \n","\nMost word processors or note taking tools use a blank document as the fundamental unit. My writing process works best when I break ideas up into smaller units. It can be difficult when I am always thinking at the scope of an entire document. When I first start having an idea it is not a full document, it is a brief thought. As I start expanding on that beginning, it is helpful to break up my related ideas into distinct units. I want my writing tool to use this structure, rather than dropping me in a blank document. Word processors are are powerful tools since their flexibility allows them to support many different writing pursuits. Since my tool only has to support my own writing practice I can make it fit that use case tightly.  \n\nAt a high level here is the structure that I want the tool to follow:\n1. Each **piece** of writing is a collection of smaller related ideas. These small ideas should are related to each other forming a more overarching narrative.  We will call each of these small ideas a **card.**\n2. There are common themes that I am exploring in my writing which I will return to over time. Each piece is connected to one or more theme.\n3. It is important to push pieces towards a finished state. I do not want all my half baked ideas milling around in my tool forever.  I should either turn them into a finished piece or I should abandon them. Finishing a piece does not mean it is the last time I will think about it but it means done for now. \n4. It should be easy to explore my writing. I want to see how ideas have changed over time and how different ideas connect. There is not one defined path to an idea, but the same idea can be reached in many different ways. \n\nThe next few sections go into more details about how a piece of software will actualize this structure\n","\n- My basic unit of written work will be called a **card**.  A card is a paragraph or a couple of paragraphs about one idea. A card will have a title summarizing the topic.\n- Each written **piece** is a collection of one or more cards. \n- All collections have one or more **series**  they are a part of.  A **series** is a topic or category that explains what is in the content of the collection of cards. A collection of cards can be in more than one series. Some example series are `whoami` `meditation``writing`\u2026\n- This tool will include **pieces** which are in different stages of completion. Each piece will fall into one of three categories:\n\t1. Finished\n\t2. In Progress\n\t3.  Abandoned \n","\n\nThe details below define how the writing structure will be displayed to a viewer. To making navigating all writing pieces easy, I want the tool to have the following properties.  \n\n1. It is easy to navigate from one idea to the next. It should feel so easy to quickly jump around to other ideas.  \n2. There are many different paths a viewer can take to the same idea. There is not only one path to discover an idea.  \n3. Each idea might appear in multiple spots.  \n\nTo achieve this, the software tool will have three separate components. These components are\n\n1. **A series viewer** - Appears as a column on the left side of the screen. Allows the user to select a specific series they are interested in. Provides high level details about that series. \n2. **A card collection viewer** -  Appears as a column on the right side of the screen. Allows the user to select a specific card collection they are interested. Shows all the cards in that collection along with a small table of contents. \n3. **A card collection canvas** - Occupies the middle of the screen.  A canvas that shows all the other pieces associated with what is currently open in the Series Viewer and the Card Collection Viewer.  \n\n","\nThere are four different possibilities for how the canvas will be populated based on the active pieces.\n\n1. Series viewer = Empty, card collection view = Empty:\nThe canvas will contain every series with all the pieces in that series. Every single card collection will be on the canvas.\n\n2. Series viewer = Active, card collection view = Empty:\nThe canvas will contain every card collection which is present in that series. The canvas will have a colored border which corresponds to that series to show that every piece is in this series.  In the canvas all of the pieces will be organized based on the other series they are in. There will be smaller boxes for each overlapping series and all the pieces in that overlapping series. If a piece is in multiple other series it will show up in multiple places on the canvas.\n\t\n3. Series viewer = Empty, card collection view = Active\nThe canvas is not surrounded by one box, but has multiple boxes on it for each series. Every series that is associated with the current card collection shows up on the canvas. Pieces which are are directly linked to from the current piece are highlighted with a special color.\n\n4.  Series viewer = Active, card collection view = Active: \nThe canvas display is mostly determined based on what is in the card collection. The active series also gets displayed on the canvas.\n\n","\nNow that we have defined  how different pieces of writing will be displayed we can define how we want users to navigate the writing. When a user first lands on the website they will be presented with an introduction screen giving some background details about the project. They will then have the opportunity to enter the tool at a few different starting points. Users will then be able to change what is active in the three sections through these interactions. \n\n- Clicking on a series box will make that series active in the series viewer. This will then update the canvas to have all the collections from that new series.\n- A collection can be clicked on and that collection will pop up in the collection viewer on the right side of the screen.\n- A viewer can zoom in and out on the canvas. At the default zoom only the title of cards is shown. As you zoom in enough on a card the text that is contained in the card will also show up.\n- The user will have the ability to X a series or card collection.\n- In the top right corner the user will be able to toggle which stages of pieces they want to see. They might only want to see finished pieces, or only want to see pieces that are in progress.\n\n","\nThe above three sections have defined the details of how to view static text pieces. In this section I am going to give details of how I want to edit text.\n\nFor each collection of cards the user will have the following abilities\n\t1. Change the title of the collection\n\t2. Change the title of a card in the collection\n\t3. Change the text of a card in the collection\n\t4. Change the order of cards in the collection by dragging them\n\t5. Remove a card from the collection by dragging it onto the canvas\n\t6. Add a card to the collection by dragging it onto the collection\n\t7. Add a card to the collection by clicking a plus button at the bottom of the collection\n\t8. Switch the state of collection from In progress, to finished or abandoned. \n\t9. Update the series that the collection is associated with\n\nThe user will have the following abilities through interacting with the canvas\n\t1. The ability to create a new card. This will be done through a left click on the canvas\n\t2. Group together multiple cards into one collection. This will be done by dragging one collection of cards onto on top of another\n\t3. Move a card in or out of a series. This will be done by moving the card inside or outside of a series box.\n\t4. Change how a series displays on the canvas. The user will be able to do this by dragging around Cards within the Series.\n\t\n","\nThe tool that I have outlined here has a lot of different parts. I am going to develop it iteratively. Here are some of my initial ideas about how I might go about the development to make the process a bit easier.\n\n1. I am going to start by just working on the viewing functionality and not the editing functionality. I can keep using Bear as my writing platform for now and just export all of my notes from there.\n2. Everything needed to render all the writing correctly will be stored in the text of the documents. There will not need to be a full fledged database. Here is some ways we will add structure to the documents so that everything can be stored in them.\n\t- The first line of a document is a single # header with the title of the piece. \n\t- After that comes a line which defines all the series. Each series is surrounded on both sides by a #\n\t- Each card begins with a ## header. Every card ends with a horizontal line divider.\n- I am going to use a [router](https:\/\/reactrouter.com\/en\/main) to make it so that links to certain pieces or cards can be shared. The url will contain three pieces of information. The series, the piece and the active card.\n\n","\nIn this document so far I have only outlined my beginning ideas for Chron. I have a number of ideas for how to extend Chron that are not fully fleshed out. Briefly they are: \n\n* It could be nice to have the layout flexible enough that someone could view multiple card collections at the same time. Often when I am reading a piece and it links to another I want to look at that other piece without leaving the current piece. We could accomplish this by having pieces stack to the right. When you open another card collection it goes to the right of the current piece and the screen scrolls to the right. \n\n * As I have more pieces contained in this tool it might be helpful to have series nested in side of each other. For example there might be a series `writing.tooling`. Tooling is a series that is completely inside of the writing series. As one series gets quite large this is a way to provide additional structure to the series.\n \n * I have some interest in adding some functionality related to each piece having an intended audience. I have found  is helpful to have an intended audience that I am thinking of when I write. This functionality could also help direct readers to how some other writing might be a good prerequisite before reading the current piece. \n\n* I interested in adding functionality which forces me to return to ideas. I either have to continue making progress on them or they are killed off. This prevents me from leaving ideas hanging around all the time. We might call this functionality \u201cweeding\u201c\n\n* I am also interested in adding functionality related to writing exercises. Sometimes it can be helpful to do a writing exercise with some format to get my brain flowing. It could be nice to have some ability to start a writing exercise when I am struggling on a piece. \n\n* There is some interesting displays I could add related to version history. It could allow the user to see how a piece has changed over time or how the entire series has changed over time. \n\n* I will be interested in understanding how different users interact with the pieces. I would be curious to track the different paths that users take through all the different pieces.\n\n* It could be nice to have some ability for other users to leave comments on my writing. Part of the reason that I write is to get other people\u2019s reactions and having comments integrated in the tool could be a really nice way to do that.\n\n","\nA lot of the ideas for Chron are inspired from other tools that I have used.

I have found the Jhanas immensely helpful for developing my own practice. I was meditating intermittently for about five years before I learned about the Jhanas. After my friend [Stephen](https:\/\/twitter.com\/zerfas33?lang=en) introduced me to the Jhanas,  meditation started having a much larger positive impact on my life. The Jhanas were a feedback loop making me more likely to mediate by turning it into a pleasurable experience. \n\nThis piece is an overview of my experience with the Jhanas. It contains both an overview of the Jhanas generally, as well as my experience of the Jhanas. My  understanding of the Jhanas has changed over time so this piece is a snapshot of my current understanding. As my practice deepens I am sure certain things that I say in this piece will be updated.  \n\nThe Jhanas are **fabricated perception filters** that help practitioners learn to let go of control and let go of fabrication. The Jhanas are fabrications in the same way that all of our experience is fabricated. We fabricate our experience by transforming raw sensory input into interpretations and projections. The Jhanas are simplified fabrications relative to our general day to day operating mode. By working with simple fabrications we learn to skillfully recognize and let go of fabrication. To enter the Jhanas one has to let go of tight control over their mental experience. Instead one has to allow their experience to unfold. Accessing the Jhanas helps us  transition to a less controlling role in our meditation. The practitioner also learns how to let go of strong sensations and find more subtleness in their practice. To get a sense for how this happens as one progresses through the Jhanas,  the eight Jhanas are listed below.\n\n1. Overwhelming glee and joy\n2. In the moment pleasant contentedness\n3. Long term deep seated confidence and tranquility\n4. Neither painful nor pleasurable imperturbable stillness\n5. Infinite space\n6. Infinite consciousness\n7. Infinite nothingness\n8. Neither perceiving nor non perceiving\n\nEach transition to a higher Jhana brings the practitioner to a subtler state with less fabrication. \n","\nThe Jhanas are one framework that can be used to guide a meditation practice. I have found the Jhanas to be the most helpful framework for developing my practice.  Once I experienced the first Jhana it became immediately apparent how much of an impact meditation could have on my day to day experience. Here is a list of the ways experiencing the Jhanas can help support an individual: \n\n1. Accessing the Jhanas helps develop a deep motivation to practice because they create an **experiential** understanding of how meditation can alter experience.\n2. Meditators develop a deeper understanding of how to check in and evaluate their current mental state.\n3. The Jhanas help develop a stable, unified mind which is incredibly useful. This state is especially powerful for developing a better understanding of experience.\n4. The Jhanas are inherently restful states.\n5. Regularly experiencing the Jhanas, a meditator learns that joy and contentedness are available to them regardless of the situation they are in.\n6. Moving through the Jhanas helps practitioners understand how to alter and mix their own experience using different qualities.\n7. Developing the ability to alter their experience a meditator gains an understanding of the malleability of perception\n","\nMy interest in the Jhanas was motivated by my admiration for the impact meditation has had on Stephen\u2019s live. While I had been meditating for five years and felt like meditation had profoundly helped me, it was clear that it had transformed Stephen even more so. I deeply respected the amount of calm, ease and confidence that Stephen exuded. Immediately upon meeting Stephen it was clear he was operating in a different way than most other people I knew. Wanting to understand more about Stephen\u2019s experience I took up his recommendation to read  [Right Concentration](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Right-Concentration-Practical-Guide-Jhanas\/dp\/1611802695) in the winter of 2020.\n\nLooking for opportunities to deepen my meditation practice, I also signed up for my first extended meditation retreat in January 2021 at IMS. This retreat did help me deepen my practice, but it was also the hardest thing I have ever done. I struggled with a lot of physical body discomfort and a lot of dullness. There were a few moments during the retreat when I was able to find deep stillness.  These particular moments gave me a sense of where my meditation practice could go. The retreat was also my first experience with loving kindness meditation which opened a new direction for me to explore with  my practice. While nothing transcendent happened while I was on retreat, my first experience with a Jhana happened shortly afterwards. The next weekend I was eating a bagel with Jenny and an overwhelming feeling of joy overtook me. I was sitting at our counter giggling with such a wide grin. The feeling was all encompassing. After a few minutes it eventually settled down. Over the next couple of days this happened a few more times when I was out and about in my environment. \n\nThis overwhelming experience of joy made me excited to continue meditating. I was motivated to make that feeling something I could create rather than something that happened randomly. Trying to re-create that experience I followed the instructions in Right Concentration to create a strong focus on the breath. While I was occasionally able to find some deep stillness similar to what I had experienced on retreat, nothing like a Jhana ever happened while I was meditating. \n\nWhat allowed me to access the first Jhana during meditation was a short loving kindness retreat I attended in April. Doing loving kindness mantras for many hours in a row meant I was continually evoking feelings of joy and happiness. Eventually during the last mantra of my practice \u201cmay I be happy\u201c I noticed that same giddiness and joy that I had experienced before starting to grow. Doing this regularly I learned the **tactile sensations** that were associated with that feeling.  By focusing on those sensations I learned to create that joy and giddiness even when I was sitting there doing nothing.  What helped me learn this skill was not just repeating the loving kindness phrase (\u201cmay I be happy\u201c).  Instead, I had to deeply visualize a previous experience of happiness and all that it entail. I had to conjure up the emotion as if it was happening in this moment. Through remembering previous experiences of that emotion over and over again I learned how to create that feeling without recalling a memory.\n","\nAs I continued working with the Jhanas, my mediation practice took on a completely different shape. The meditation I had been doing before learning about the Jhanas was based on using apps like Headspace and Calm. I was trying to focus on either breath or body sensations. These meditations involved a lot of coercion. I was using \u201cwillpower\u201c to get my system to operate in a certain way. Working with the Jhanas I learned that rather than pushing my attention towards the breath, I could relax and release into the breath. Meditation switched from being a stressful environment that asked me to behave in a certain way, to a relaxing and soothing environment.\n\nFor the first time in my live I had a consistent meditation practice that I was excited about. I was able to sit basically every day because I was no longer coercing myself to meditate because I knew it was good for me. I continued my development with the Jhanas using a couple of different resources as guides. I used [The Mind Illuminated](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness-ebook\/dp\/B01INMZKAQ?crid=3IHJ7GDTHSXPW&keywords=the+mind+illuminated&qid=1680807930&s=books&sprefix=the+mind+illuminated,stripbooks,71&sr=1-1) to pair with Right Concentration as a resource to explain how the Jhanas progressed. I learned to consistently find Jhana 2 by doing the receiving of love practices in [Awakening through Love](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Awakening-Through-Love-Unveiling-Goodness\/dp\/0861715373). \n\nThe Jhanas also changed my meditation practice by making joy a central part of it. Before meditation was about developing the skill of focus. Now, it was about creating a joyful environment. My practice centered on finding joy that was not dependent on any particular experience. Being able to find joy in everyday mundane experiences was such a profound gift. During the day, whenever I feel anxious or bored, I am now able to check in and connect with a sense of happiness. Overtime by consistently seeing that joy is always accessible to me, some amount of tranquility has arisen. I have integrated that no matter what situation I am in, I am always going to be able to find joy.\n","\n\nIn the middle of march I went on a week long [Jhana retreat](https:\/\/www.jhourney.io\/jhana-retreat) that was organized by Stephen. The retreat was taught by [Jason Bartlett](https:\/\/luminousdharma.org\/teacher\/) who gave me a ton of practical advice that helped deepen my practice. Jason is a very practical teacher that pushed me to use retreat as an incredible opportunity to deepen my practice. Jason pushed me to stay in each Jhana for a longer period of time. Before retreat, when I was working with the Jhanas I would cycle between them a bunch. Rather than just sitting in Jhana 1 or 2, I would constantly be shifting back and forth between them. \n\nJason gave me the framework that the key from shifting towards higher Jhanas is to let go of what is making me tired. During my practice I should sit in Jhana 1 for as long as I can. Once I notice myself becoming tired, I should try to find what in my experience is making me tired and let go of that. Through this process, Jhana 2 will arise in a natural way. In order to transition to a higher Jhana, I do not need to seek out a special experience. If I  stay in the lower Jhana for long enough, my body would naturally transition to the higher Jhana.\n\nJason\u2019s teaching also pushed me to interact with my experience of each Jhana in new ways. Before retreat I had mostly focused my practice on learning  the initial signal to enter into a Jhana. But I had not built up the skill of being able to stay in a Jhana for a long time. Coming out of retreat I have learned some other ways I can work with Jhana related sensation. I can now relax into the sensation and let it spread to my entire body. I can take a step back and observe the sensation rather than just experiencing it. I can also turn the intensity of the sensation down will still maintaining a focus on it. The retreat helped me develop a whole new set of skills when working with Jhana related sensations. \n\nAnother direction that Jason suggested we experiment with is to make Jhanas a non-volitional experience. When I am doing Jhana practice sometimes I am constantly evaluating my experience. I am trying to classify my experience or effecting really hard to push it in a certain direction. Jason suggested that we should not expect our experience  to be one thing, but rather just  allow our Jhana experience to happen. I found this teaching to be really helpful particular for understanding the transition from Jhana 3 to Jhana 4.\n\nBy the end of retreat, I was able to access Jhana 3 and Jhana 4 basically every sit. When I was learning Jhana 3 and Jhana 4 I initially struggled with moving my breath into the background. This was actually a struggle that I have had with all of the Jhanas when I first learned them. I had trouble focusing on the sensation of the Jhana because I would sometimes be caught focusing on my breath instead. To work with this difficult I learned how to fuse my breath with the Jhana and not have the breath and the Jhana be different things.  When I breath in, I grow the sensation of the Jhana, when I breath out I relax. After doing this for a while the sensation of the Jhana becomes so strong that the breath drops into the background.\n\n","\n\nI am going to end this post with some details about the different sensations I experience for each Jhana.\n\nTo enter into  **Jhana 1** I put my attention at the corners of my mouth and start smiling. There is a rush of  sensation in the rest of my head that moves upwards. Emotionally I start feeling quite happy and joyful. It feels like I am running around outside in the summer in the sun. Or my favorite song just came on and I am excited to dance. Jhana 1 is very high energy,  feeling similar to a runners high. Generally, Jhana 1 has some vibratory pulsing or a body buzz. Especially as I spread the sensation to the rest of my body. To spread the sensation to the rest of my body, I let go of it and allow it to spread. Letting go of the sensation is accompanied by a small movement backwards and upwards.\n\nTo transition into  **Jhana 2**I need to tone down some of the energy in Jhana 1. I do this by finding some of that high energy joy in the top of my head and turning it off. Turning it off is accompanied with a downward sensation like switching off a light bulb. To find Jhana 2 I then put sensation either at the corner of my lips or at my chest center. Rather than pushing energy up like I did with Jhana 1 I then push energy out. Jhana 2 is a subtler sensation than Jhana 1. Another way to think about the subtleness is to think of a lower frequency. The amount of sensation is greatly diminished. For me the emotion of Jhana 2 is similar to the feeling of just having taken the first bite of a really good piece of food. It is also similar to the feeling of being proud of myself after a presentation or conversation has gone really well. To release Jhana 2 to the rest of my body I pull a similar move to how I spread Jhana 1. \n\nTransitioning to **Jhana 3** involves a similar move to how I transitioned from Jhana 1 to Jhana 2. I find the highest energy part of Jhana 2 and I turn it off. To find the sensation of Jhana 3 I either focus at the center of my mouth or my core. With Jhana 3 I focus on a circle at either of those sensations that is pulsing inwards on itself. Jhana 3 still has some pleasantness associated with it so I try to have a very small smile.  The emotional feeling of Jhana 3 is similar to the feeling of knowing that I have had a full day and there is nothing left to do. I have a deep seated confidence that I have made the right decisions in my life and that I am in the right place. \n\n**Jhana 4** feels like it should almost belong in a different category that 1-3 because the experience does not map clearly to something I regularly encounter during my day to day. To transition into Jhana 4 I turn off all the contentedness that I am feeling in Jhana 3. This puts me in a spot where I am not feeling anything in particular, but in a very calm state where lots of sensations are occurring across my entire body. It is helpful to be in a  very calm state to enter Jhana 4. When I am leaving Jhana 3 I am evoking the sensation of turning everything off in my body. Then to enter Jhana 4 I bring to mind upward sensation across the back of my entire head. This sensation is  accompanied by a some brightening of my visual field. Jhana 4 feels like I have reached a place of luminous stillness. There is no pleasure or pain present, just existence. When Jhana 4 comes on, it feels like I have become unfrozen. Before I was stuck in a particular position and now I can stand up and walk around in the space.  Jhana 4 makes me feel like I can not be disturbed and and that I have a heightened perceptual understanding.\n\n\n\n\n"],"filename":"my_experience_with_the_jhanas"},{"created":1651235728792,"modified":1681469074683,"title":"What are my stances","status":"In Progress","tags":["whoami","top_of_mind"],"blocks":["Why I am defining my values","Motivating Principles","Daily Principles","Concrete Actions"],"blocks_text":["\n2.

Soulmaking Dhamma is a recent buddhist inspired framework created by Rob Burbea and Catherine McGee. I was excited for this course because I have found Rob Burbea\u2019s lectures  to be quite dynamic. His lectures on the Jhanas are both precise and actionable. Soulmaking is Burbea\u2019s remix \/ extension of  some core buddhist teachings. These notes are an overview of my understanding of  Soulmaking from this past weekend. These notes should be seen as my understanding of the teachings and how I connected with them rather than a faithful transcription of what was taught.\n\nSoulmaking challenges traditional buddhist teaching by suggesting skillful ways we can use fabrication. If we only focusing on removing fabrication we actually lose something. Soulmaking uses the term imaginal rather than the term fabrication. Similarily to how buddhist teachings point out that we are always fabrication, soul making identifies that we are always using our imagination. In all moment huge parts of our experience are mental constructs. Soulmaking reframes practice as not only about deconstructing that imagination, but also find ways to skillful alter or use our imagination. \n\nThe workshop consisted of sections on three different topics: emptiness, desire and sacredness.\n","\nSoulmaking\u2019s discussion of emptiness closely aligns with traditional buddhist teachings. In Buddhism, the concept of emptiness asks us to realize that there is no inherent quality to anything. We use practice to recognize the ways we fabricate our experience and give it specific meaning. If we are able to strip away that fabrication we see that at the core, everything is supposedly *empty*. Soulmaking repackages emptiness by suggesting we **\u201cdevelop a flexibility with a range of ways of looking\u201c**.  Soulmaking challenges us to recognize the predominate way we perceive everything we come in contact with. Through practice we learn how this predominate way of looking is habitually ingrained in us from our previous history and social conditions. By creating space from that way of looking, we can explore many different ways of looking. For example, when I am annoyed by someone on public transportation, I can choose to instead view them as someone who has had a difficult day just trying to get home.  \n\nWhile traditional buddhist teaching pushes us to see emptiness by reducing fabrication, Soulmaking asks us to explore different fabrications. By experiencing many different fabrications, we understand that no one fabrication is the truth. I find this teaching direction more accessible than removing fabrication, because I have naturally experienced  different ways of looking before. Historically in my life, my perception has shifted about a topic when I have gained more information. I have been able to understand someone who annoys me better when I learn more about their background.  Recognizing how I actively shape my own perception is a really helpful perspective. Knowing that there exists a malleability in my experience can really open up some ease. \n\nBefore Burbea developed soulmaking he worked extensively with emptiness. His well known book [Seeing That Frees](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Seeing-That-Frees-Robert-Burbea\/dp\/0992848911) is centered on emptiness. After his deep exploration with emptiness, Burbea felt that we can\u2019t only focus on reducing fabrication. While reducing fabrication is clearly one way of looking that can he helpful, it is not all there is. This does add an extra complication into practice though! We cannot simply say the less fabrication the better. We have to build an understanding of which fabrications are helpful and which fabrications are harmful. Some of the rest of soul making speaks to understanding what types of fabrication might be helpful. \n","\nSoulmaking disagrees with the buddhist view that we should completely let go of desire since it is the root of suffering. Soulmaking believes there are skillful ways we can open to desire, without it becoming craving. This skillful opening to desire means we no longer have to collapse, deny or close ourselves off to desire. Soulmaking recognizes that there are many powerful ways we can turn towards desire. The teachers helped us see this by asking us to examine the role of desire in our meditation practice. Some form of desire is what led us to meditation.\n\nWhile being quite different, Soulmaking still works with desire in some traditional buddhist ways. Soulmaking stresses the importance of developing some  distance from desire, building our ability to recognize that our desires are not us. A key part of working with desire is to recognize emptiness in our desire. We need to recognize that even if we obtain our desires they might not meet the needs we thought they would. Working with desire in this way requires us building enough mindfulness to observe desire without attaching to it. Soulmaking pushes beyond the traditional view by asking us to build the skill of  desiring something, without  feeling disappointment if we do not have it. We need to learn to let our desire burn strongly without needing to act on it.  Soulamking recognize how traditional buddhist practices give some skillful ways of working with desire, but also close us off in another ways.  \n","\nThe last section of the weekend focused on developing skills to find sacredness in our lives. The teachers defined sacredness as **\u201ca sense of contact with an other that cannot be reduced\u201c** .  Another framing that they gave for sacredness is **finding beauty**.  The key element of sacredness is an experience which cannot be simplified into a short meaning.\n\nSoulmaking teaches the importance of finding ways to open ourselves to sacred experiences. It is not simply that we should try to make everything sacred. Part of what makes an experienced sacred  is its rarity. While sacred experiences cannot be easily summarized, there is a pattern in how we experience them. The teachers suggested one of these patterns is that sacred experiences feel like they have an importance to them. \n\nSacredness is connected to emptiness because we need the skill of  looking in different ways to find more sacredness. When the teachers were going through this section, I felt myself recoiling from the term sacredness. I find phrasing sacredness as **deep resonant encompassing connection with another** to be appealing. Using this phrasing, I was able to find some pattern in my historical experiences that might contain sacredness. Historically, a powerful pattern in sacred events is that they diminish my sense of self. \n\nSoulmaking differs from other common framings by suggesting that sacredness can come from a recognition of difference and not only from oneness. Many traditional views suggest finding sacredness by highlighting similarity or commonality in experience. They suggest seeking sacredness through recognizing the ways we are all connected. Soulmaking highlights that a scared experience can actually come from diversity rather than similarity.

The idea last night is related to utility functions. Also, I have no understanding of the Econ literature out there, so this might not really make any sense! But here was the idea I was having about how to tweak a model I have seen before.\n\nI was thinking about the model of consumption v labor we worked with in Econ 200. A person allocates some percentage of their hours to labor and some percentage to leisure. Their labor choice impacts how much they can consume. Given a functional form, we found the number of hours of labor that maximized utility for that person. \n\nHere are some ideas about how to extend that model a few ways:\n- Imagine a person starts at a certain point on the curve somewhat randomly. They start not at their maximum, but just a random allocation between labor and leisure. This person has the ability to change how many hours they allocate to labor. We are interested in understanding if they will switch their behavior to their maximum utility. Why or why not? It feels helpful to start from a place of behavior change, rather than picking from scratch.\n- One way to set up the model might be to include some amount of switching cost. Any amount of change in your behavior incurs some cost. This cost could be one reason that people do not change their behavior. And maybe the larger the change (the further away the point) the higher the switching cost.\n- Another way to extend this, is having uncertainty about other points. You know (or at least have some sense) of the utility you get from your current point. But you really dont know anything about what utility might be like at other points. Currently you work 40 hours a week. You probably have a good sense of what utility might be like working 39 hours a week, but what about 20 hours a week? What about 10 hours a week? \n- Or maybe another way to extend the model, is that people  gain utility from having continuity. It is hard for people to change from working 40 hours a week to 10 hours a week. Not because of anything about the actual situation, but because just being in a completely different allocation is hard. Now that I am writing this out, I think this is same thing as a switching cost, but just a different way to put it. \n- What if we thought about this problem of figuring out the correct allocation for you as a multi armed bandit problem? You need to explore the space to find the correct allocation. Are people currently exploring the space well? My intuition is that people get stuck in very small sections of the possible space, rather than really exploring it. Why might this be? \n\nWriting out this whole thing, I realized that the core motivating question is \u201cWhy are people not changing their behavior more?\u201c.  And I am trying to motivate some of these ideas based on my own experiences. Like why did we not buy a night light sooner? Without knowing anything, it feels like there are compelling ways to slightly complicate models, that can really speak to this behavior."],"filename":"econ_project_with_jenny"},{"created":1682324230704,"modified":1682504055826,"title":"Existing Meditation Frameworks","status":"In Progress","tags":["meditation"],"blocks":["Jhanas Leading to Cessation","Burbea - everything is emptiness","TMI Insight Experiences"],"blocks_text":["\n- Path To Nibbana by Dhamma Sukkha\n- Use the Jhanas to eventually be able to view dependent origination\n- Working towards cessations\n- cessations lead to Arhant ship\n","\n- no self and importance are just manifestations of emptiness\n\n\n","\n- - Insights is the goal of meditation!!\n- Use breath based breathing to really quite the mind\n\t- need to be focused to actually update the mind \n\t\t- without having a unified mind, you can see the insight, but you will not experience any update\n- then do insight based practices\n\t- insight experiences are not uncommon, we just tend to overlook them\n\nFive key insights that lead to awakening\n- impermanence\n- emptiness\n- the causal interdependence of all phenomena -> dependent co-origination\n- Desire is the case of suffering\n- No self\n\t- this is the culminating insight that creates awakening \n\n* Will power is not helpful\n\t* Gives you many different challenges to try out\n\n\n\n- Still has cessations events, but cessation events are not the only point\n- basically do breath based meditation for a long time, then eventually do insight based meditation\n\t- walking meditation and metta meditation are useful tools\n- the Jhanas are also a useful tool that can be helpful when you are a more advanced meditator\n\n> However, from this point forward, you will increasingly have Insight experiences that can the kind of Insight (vipassana) that leads to Awakening.

It has drastically changed my personality. I have so much interest in exploring meditation because of the way it has transformed my live positively.\n\nAs I have more seriously explore meditation, I have entered into communities where others are very experienced meditators. In this communities there is often a large focus on which teachings are correct and on the original teachings of the buddha. While there is a lot of wisdom in the buddha\u2019s teachings and other historical teachings, they also are from a different time period. Life looked very different back then.

Even though meditation is something which can be so positive, it is something that not that many people do. \n\nThis piece involves me trying to package some of the deeper aspects of buddhism in a way that I find to be appealing and accessible.\n\nBuckminster Fuller quote\n> ~\u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality.

Itself to be something different or to view from a different perspective\n\nThe long term goal of meditation is to help you have some of these realizations\n\n I do believe that we experience moments of  high neuroplasticity, where we make a realization and our thinking changes afterwards. I remember having the realization in college that free will is not a real thing and that I do not actually have control. I remember the moment so so clearly and after that moment my thinking for sure changed. I really love Culdasa\u2019s idea that in meditation we are building the necessary unity and concentration so that when we have these insight experiences, we are tuned in enough so that they will actually have a large effect.

Through media and our interactions with others we receive information about who we should emulate. This means that we are more likely to replicate people who are similar to those who are currently seen as successful. If we want different outcomes that the ones we are experiencing now we need to give other models for what success looks like. \n\n\nKey Principles\n1.

Different funding sources are optimal for different types of projects.  If we want diversity in the type of projects that are being pursued, then we also need diversity in how those projects get funded. \n\n> When only certain types of projects or directions receive funding then we are leaving an immense amount of exploration on the table. Ideas that could be valuable are never even explored.\n\nThese thoughts on funding models are surfacing through thinking about what I want my own career to look like. What are the projects that I want to work on and how am I going to get them funded? \n\nThe beginning of this post is self reflection about what I want my own career to look like. After concluding that the most common funding sources would not support the type of work that I want to do, I explore crowdfunding projects. I conclude by proposing a new model for crowdfunding based on using tokens and the implications this could have on labor.\n\n-----\nI find it helpful to use my peers as guideposts for what I want my career to look like. One common aspiration among many of my peers is to build a startup. There are a number of reasons why this might be an attractive path for me: \n\n1. I would be working on something that I personally created rather than helping someone else carry out their vision. Part of that attraction is probably due to my ego. But a company that I build is more likely to be closely aligned with my personal values.\n2. Not only would I be working on a project that I believe is important but I would be building a community. Building communities that allow people to flourish is one of the most rewarding things I can do.\n3. I would get to learn about many different parts of building a business. My current and previous jobs have only spoken to a small part of the entire business. When building a business from scratch the founders have to learn about all aspects.\n4. As a company grows the role of a founder constantly changes. This requires evolving and constantly learning a new role. A good founder is doing very different things when a company is 5 people, 20 people, 50 people and so on. \n\nWhile I am somewhat attracted to founding a startup, it actually feels like the wrong decision for me. Taking Venture Capital investment, which is the predominant way technology startups are funded, causes companies to direct energy away from delivering values to users.\n\nWhen a startup is first created, the project is in the explore phase. The founders have an idea about how to create something valuable. They are exploring that idea and want to understand the value of what they are creating. That explore phase is the most exciting part of any project to me. Time in that phase is spent exploring fundamental questions and pushing knowledge forward. \n\nSince start ups have to deliver a return on their investment, they are forced to transition eventually from this explore phase to an exploit phase. VC firms only invest in projects that have an opportunity to bring very large returns. The exploit phase is about finding the best way to monetize and grow your product. In an ideal world this phase is about increasing impact by bringing your product to more people. From my experience though, companies measure their success not on value delivered, but on revenue and size of funding rounds. Since companies know they are measured by these metrics, they focus on optimizing them rather than  delivering value to users. VC funding provided the opportunity for the explore phase but also mandates that it eventually transitions into the exploit phase.\n\nHaving such a focus on creating a return on investment feels antithetical to what I want to be doing. For my own work, I would rather be spending time in the explore phase. I do not want to be spending time thinking about how to extract value from users, but rather how to deliver value to them. This means that I do not want to use VC funding on my own projects. \n\n","\nBased on my preference for doing exploration work over exploitation work it would seem like getting a PHD and becoming a professor at a university might be a desirable path. There are a number of things that I do find enticing about that direction:\n\n1. The most rewarding work I have ever done is when I was doing computer science research as an undergraduate. I was working at the cutting edge of how humans interact with AI systems. I was reading other researcher\u2019s papers and building off of their ideas. It felt like I was truly working in uncharted territory and trying to help a field move forward.\n2. Teaching has always been something that I find to be incredibly meaningful. There are so many teachers, both academic and not that I have learned from and who have inspired me. While most jobs involve some sort of teaching, it is desirable to have part of my job explicitly be devoted to it. \n3. Academic research is not motivated by creating a profitable business. The work does not need to create something that is immediately of monetary value. (This does not mean it is not tied to money in a perverse way though!)\n4. Professors are regularly interacting with and learning from young people. College students have some of the most creative minds and have not lost their curiosity and excitement. \n\nWhile having a job in academia is quite desirable for the reasons I listed above, it also has a number of drawbacks. In academia, the biggest marker of success is whether or not you receive tenure. Tenure decisions are made almost solely on how prestigious your research papers are considered. Since tenure decisions are based on research papers, you\u2019re incentivized to focus on making as many papers as possible. That means researchers will focus on creating the smallest possible publishable unit of work or making incremental changes to existing work rather than exploring newer ideas. \n\nI also find research papers to be an unsatisfactory final product for a project. The majority of research papers are inaccessible and written for a very narrow audience. Since incentives in academia are tied to research papers, that is often where work ends. This means that academic research is far away from actual implementation. Researchers themselves often do not implement their ideas but are reliant on someone else reading their paper and pushing their work forward. Academic prestige is therefore not necessarily based on impact on society, but rather what other people in that small community think of your work. \n\nI mentioned earlier that I do not want to be working in the exploit phase, but there are a lot of desirable traits that have been developed in the exploit phase that are not present in academia. Companies in the exploit phase usually have an intense focus on the end user and delivering something that is impactful. No matter what type of work I am doing, I want to be focused on the impact of my work and making it as accessible to others as possible. \n\nHaving spent time now working in both academia and industry (at both large companies and small companies) neither feels like it is a perfect fit. I want to be doing work in the explore phase, but still be thinking about users and directly pushing the impact of my work forward. I do not want to be spending my time thinking about how to extract value from users and how to deliver a return on an investment. \n------\nIf neither academia or industry is a good fit for what I want to be doing, what other paths are there available for me?\n\n[Andy Matuschuk](~https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/~) is an independent researcher who is carving a new path for himself. Andy\u2019s research explores tools that support knowledge creation and retention. His current project is creating  a new reading medium called [Orbit](~https:\/\/withorbit.com\/~). Orbit uses spaced repetition to help the reader better retain what they are learning. While I find the research that Andy is doing compelling, I am more interested in how he is funding that research. Andy is completely funded through crowdsourcing using Patreon.  In exchange for supporting Andy on Patreon, you are granted access to a subset of his writing.\n\n[Andy has argued](~https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/2020\/~) that the work he is doing is only possible because of this different funding model he has taken. If he was in academia he would be spending his time on research papers rather than creating actual software. If he had taken VC funding he would have to be devoting energy to monetizing what he is creating. This alternative funding model of crowdsourcing research funding through patreon has created a project that would not exist otherwise. \n\nIn Andy\u2019s[ own writing](~https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/2020\/~) he has highlighted that his path might not be reproducible for all projects. His work is \u201cobviously legible to casual observers\u201d and therefore can have a very large reach, which is not true of all work. Having such a large reach means that Andy only needs to receive a little bit of money from each of his supporters. While Andy has found success asking for a small amount of support from a lot of people, that model might not be ideal for some other projects. \n\nIf I believe Andy\u2019s funding model (or something like it) is ideal for the projects I want to work on, then I have to find some way to reproduce some of what he has done. When thinking about my own projects in the future, some of them might not have a very large appeal. One project I have been interested in is building better documentation tools for machine learning practitioners. Creating tooling that makes all the different paths they tried and the hidden assumptions baked into their work legible for external parties. This type of project is not as understandable by a large audience and therefore might struggle to have a large reach. \n\nNot only will some projects struggle to have large audiences, but it might also be ideal for projects to have a fewer number of funders. With a smaller group of funders, the creator can have a more intimate relationship with each one. With a large group of funders you might barely have a relationship with any of them. Having a smaller group of people who funds you allows for a deeper and more intimate relationship.\n\nFor each project and for each creator the ideal number of funders is different. I am not aware of any projects funded with about 50 - 100 people. At 50 - 100 people it would still be possible to have a relationship with each funder. You could meet with them once a year and hear their feedback. But to only be supported by 50 to 100 people, the creator would need to get more support from each funder. \n\nThere are many creators who have proven the success of crowdfunding to support their work. In exchange for the content they create, funders receive some service or product. I pay [Ben Thompson](~https:\/\/stratechery.com\/~) ten dollars every month because I want to read his writing. I pay [Zeynep Tufkeci](~https:\/\/www.theinsight.org\/~) ten dollars a month because I learn a ton from her. Similarly there are artists, video creators and many products that have had success using [Patreon](~https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/home~) or [Kickstarter](~https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/~).  This relationship of paying a creator for the content they produce through a subscription is quite normalized now. \n\nFor me to pay more money to these creators, it would have to be an investment rather than paying for a service\/product. I can buy an IPhone from Apple, but I also can invest in Apple. When I buy a product, that is money I am spending, but when I make an investment I am trying to grow my wealth. An investment would mean that I am a part owner of the creator\u2019s project and as their project grew, I would receive a return for my investment. By turning my contribution into an investment, I am willing to contribute a greater amount of money.\n\nIf the amount of money received from each individual is larger the number of funders needed can decrease. Needing fewer funders makes projects that do not have as large of an appeal more viable. \n","\nWith some tweaks on Andy\u2019s current model it could support projects that do not have as broad of an appeal. I first formulated this idea while listening to a discussion between [Li Jin](~https:\/\/li-jin.co\/about\/~),[ Eugune Wei](~https:\/\/www.eugenewei.com\/~) and a couple of others about building creator communities. In passing they mentioned using tokens to support your project rather than just monetary contributions.  I also recently read this [substack article](~https:\/\/tals.substack.com\/p\/creator-daos~) about \u201ccreator decentralized autonomous organizations\u201d. Here is the important excerpt from the article explaining how tokens might be used to support a project\n\n> For example, a group of people who wanted to design a line of shoes might sell tokens in their project to people who believed in their vision. These tokens would bestow several privileges on their holders. They might provide token-holders with discounted pricing and\/or priority access to the project\u2019s product. They could give token-holders the ability to vote on shoe designs or other project decisions. They might even provide token-holders with a share of profits when such exist. And of course, the tokens could be sold to other people for profit, if as a result of the success of the project the value of the token increased. In addition to cash, tokens might be earned through work on the project. Designers, marketers, manufacturing and financial experts could be awarded tokens in return for their involvement in the shoe project. Even smaller contributions, like helping a social campaign go viral or providing survey feedback on packaging, could result in token grants.\n\n> So how is this different from crowdfunding like Kickstarter or membership platforms like Patreon? These three frameworks have plenty in common, most importantly, the goal of making it possible for more people to make stuff. But the main difference that a Creator DAO provides is the notion of ownership. You are not simply supporting a project. Through the token, you possess a piece of it. And, within the rules of its smart contract, are free to use the token as you want. You can sell it, stake it, fractionalize it, include it in an index, take advantage of all of the liquidity-enhancing mechanisms DeFi enables. In other words, with a CreatorDAO, in addition to wanting to help people make stuff because you like the stuff they\u2019ll make, you get financial incentives. You are an investor. A true owner.\n\nHere is what applying this model to a project like Andy\u2019s would look like:\n\n* Rather than accepting cash contributions every month, Andy would sell tokens to people. We will call these Andy Tokens or ATs. \n* There is a generative process for ATs. Creation of ATs would be similar to other crypto currencies. A unit of work generates more ATs. With bitcoin, new coins are entered into circulation through mining, rewarding miners for their computational work. For Andy\u2019s project, whenever he does a unit of work, he gets rewarded with new ATs. For simplicity we will say he generates 50 ATs for a month of work on his project. \n* Andy can then sell these tokens to people who want to fund his project. Andy would determine the initial price for these tokens just as he determined he would accept 5 dollar contributions on Patreon. \n* When you own a certain percentage of ATs you get access to certain benefits. If you own .01% you get access to Andy\u2019s writing. If you own over 1% you can meet with Andy once a year and talk about the project with him and give feedback. \n* Since Andy generates new tokens every month, to keep your percentage of tokens constant you can buy a certain percentage of new tokens whenever they are created. \n* This setup also provides an opportunity for people to own tokens through non monetary contributions. If someone contributes to Andy\u2019s project they also generate some new tokens. \n* It also creates the opportunity for people to own tokens and sell them to others. Rather than only being able to buy from Andy you could buy tokens from another person who already owns some. People who value the tokens more can pay you for them. \n* This setup also provides an incentive for people to support you earlier in your path. When you support someone earlier in their project, you are taking on more risk, but you also have a greater chance for reward as the value of their tokens goes up. This could make it easier to have funders at the beginning of your project. \n\nProjects that are funded using the above model have different incentives then the other funding sources I have already explored. This model means the creator can be less focused on monetization and growth, and not be driven by winning the approval of her peers. By changing the monetary incentives that come with our work, different types of projects might emerge.\n\nWhat would Facebook or Google look like if they were not so focused on growth and monetization but rather on delivering value to users? Switching these incentives is essential for building a society that is not focused on revenue, profit and prestige.  \n\n\n*_Thanks to Tushar Chandra, Madison Moore, Holly Ormseth, Dan Pfiel, Jenny Wang and  Stephan Zerfas for feedback and discussions related to the ideas in this post_*\n"],"filename":"a_different_funding_model"},{"created":1688539125460,"modified":1688540171412,"title":"A Diversity of Funding Models","status":"Finished","tags":["organization_structure"],"blocks":["Which jobs are attractive","The role of funding","More diversity"],"blocks_text":["\nFor the past few months my mind has been floating to a series of thoughts that seem somehow connected but it is not quite clear to me the exact connection. Generally they all have to do with the future of work and the future of education. But so far most of these thoughts have stayed quite abstract. I have discussed them with a couple of friends, but they are readily changing and evolving. I want to push myself to write about them in a low stress way. This will hopefully help me connect them and understand more deeply why I keep returning to these thoughts. \n\nWhen I was looking for internships the junior year of college there were two main possibilities that I saw for myself. I could either go work at a consulting firm or I could go become a trader at a financial firm. When I look back at these options both of them seem terrible. At both of these places I would have been quite unhappy. But why were they the only options that I considered? Part of this is probably unique to studying at the University of Chicago, but from [Marina Keegan\u2019s essay](~https:\/\/yaledailynews.com\/blog\/2011\/09\/30\/even-artichokes-have-doubts\/~) it seems like this sentiment might also occur at other universities. These were the jobs that everyone was interested in! It only seemed natural for me to also be considering these jobs and trying to get them. Lucky for me, when I was applying to internships my junior year I did not succeed in getting any of these jobs. This lead to me doing computer science research with a professor instead. \n\nLooking back, it seems so odd that those were the jobs I was trying to get. Knowing what I do now, I would be really unhappy in those jobs. So why were they the jobs that I was attracted to? There are cultural and social reasons that those jobs are valorized, but what I want to think about now is the role that money plays in it. Both of these jobs are quite lucrative options. So many people are attracted to these jobs because of the salary that comes with it. As easy as it is to say that salary does not matter to me, I absolutely goal post jobs based on the salary that is attached to them. If a job has a higher salary attached to it I see it as more selective and more impressive to have attained that job. \n\nA bunch of college students were attracted to jobs by how much they paid, what a surprise. But focusing on this is actually really important. Even now I find it can be so difficult to break from the paths that I see a majority of other people taking (more thoughts on that to come). But when I was younger it was that much more difficult to do something different. Yes, plenty of people do it and I should not use that as an excuse, but structurally it is difficult. \n\nAs a society we want to be directing people to work on that is of high value and that will help our society. Does working in consulting or the financial industry provide some value to our society? Maybe, but both of these jobs are mostly helping wealthy people get even wealthier. They are causing more inequality and not drastically helping anyone. \n","\nFunding impacts the type of work that people do in so many different ways. I was talking about the small ways it pushes students who have been taught to follow achievement to pursue certain jobs that are not high value. But funding impacts work in so many other places and so much higher up the stack than students trying to pick which companies to work at. I had the option to do CS research because my professor had received enough funding to hire undergrad RAs. If he had not received that funding then that position would not have been available to me. But funding also impacts whether or not certain companies are even created in the first place. \n\nIf you want to start a new company it will usually involve taking on some sort of debt. If you are starting a small business that debt might be in the form of a loan from a bank, a friend or a family member. If you are creating a start up the predominant way you get it off the ground is be raising money through a venture capital firm. While venture capital has helped create lots of companies that do provide value, there are a lot of difficulties with the venture capital model. I am not well acquainted with this space, so I am sure someone else can write about it in more depth than me, but VC firms are looking for an extremely large return in their investments. VC firms are not fine with just a modest return to their investment. Since VC firms are looking for huge returns they will mostly invest in companies with large growth opportunities. \n\nBut there are many different businesses out there that might not present large growth opportunities that VC firms are looking for. Yet, if you want to start a company people know they have to raise VC funding. This puts people in the mindset of only thinking about ideas that present large growth opportunities. There are lots of ideas that are never pursued because their potential for growth might not be there. Founders need to know how their idea might turn into high growth before they pitch it. Ideas that would be modestly successfully and create a lot of value do not even see the light of day if they are not high growth. \n\nFunding also plays a huge role in academic research. Part of the reason that academic research is so different than industry is because that funding model is so different. Research delivers returns on its funding in different ways. Rather than having to build a product that makes your founders money you have to create original research. The contract then switches from investing money to make more money to investing money to create original ideas. I am so glad that this different type of funding model exists. While it has problems of its own, having more diversity in funding leads to different types of ideas being created. \n\nProfessors are constantly applying to different grants and trying to secure funding so they can carry out research. When a professor receives that grant it usually comes with some stipulations attached to it. You have to show the organization that gave you the grant that the money is going to good use and you have to deliver progress. This pushes researchers to find positive results and publish research when they might not otherwise. \n\nAlso, if there is no grant for the type of work you want to do then tough luck getting funding for it.\n\n","\nFunding and resources provide the ability for individuals to pursue ideas and build ideas. When only certain types of projects or directions will receive funding then we are leaving an immense amount of exploration on the table. Ideas that could be valuable are never even explored. At first it might be that people have these ideas but then they do not receive funding so they end up working on different things. After a certain period of time though people will stop even trying because they know only certain directions are viable. \n\nIf we want to maximize the different types of exciting and creative work that is happening in our society then we should look to create a large diversity in funding models. We should create many different ways for people to get paid for the creative work that they are doing. People should be able to work on ideas that do not have a clear path to high growth businesses. If we have more diversity in the types of ways that people can receive or raise funding then we will have more diversity in the types of work that actually happen. \n\n[Andy Mutaschuk](~https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/~) is an independent researcher exploring a new funding model - crowdfunded researcher. This post was largely inspired by his [reflection on 2020](~https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/2020\/~).\n\nWhile not directly referenced this post was also inspired by some writings from [Jason Crawford](~https:\/\/rootsofprogress.org\/posts~) and [Ben Thompson](~https:\/\/stratechery.com\/~).\n"],"filename":"a_diversity_of_funding_models"},{"created":1688540044239,"modified":1688540408053,"title":"Substack Limitations and DAO Possibilities","status":"Finished","tags":["crypto","organization_structure"],"blocks":["The Promise of Substack","Substack Limitations"," A different Setup","Improvements"],"blocks_text":["\nA year ago when I was interviewing to work at [Whisper](~https:\/\/whisper.ai\/~), I had to do a product sense interview. I was asked to think of a product that I was excited about and which I could discuss in depth. In that interview I brought up the writing platform [Substack](~https:\/\/substack.com\/~). I gushed about the possibilities of Substack: it would allow writers to directly connect with people who valued their content. Writers would be their own bosses, have better work lives and explore topics that would not get covered at a larger publication. Substack would create more niche publications that would not be available otherwise. Monetary incentives impact what type of content is created ([A Diversity of Funding Models](\/a_diversity_of_funding_models)]]) and by connecting writers directly to their readers creators are pushed to do work their readers value.\n\nA year later, the impact that Substack might have is becoming clear. While some writers have found success on the platform, many writers have found running a publication on the platform to be difficult. Writers who have thousands of subscribers are able to capture more of the value they create than they would working at a big publication. But, for some writers running their own publication is quite intense and can lead to [burn out](~https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/style\/2021\/11\/11\/a-good-newsletter-exit-strategy-is-hard-to-find~). After trying Substack, some writers have decided to leave Substack for a bigger publication like the NY Times or the[ Atlantic](~https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/11\/introducing-subscriber-newsletters\/620579\/~)\n\nWhile Substack has created some new opportunities, we can still push the relationship between writers and readers in even new directions. We can learn from what has been successful about Substack and improve on some of the things that Substack has struggled with.\n\n","\nI am going to touch on three places where Substack feels limited. Understanding these struggles will help frame what other solutions could look like.\n\n1. ","Running a business by yourself is really difficult."," When a writer uses Substack they are out on their own. Even though Substack provides tools and support to help run a newsletter, there are many tools they do not provide. The writer has to do the hard work of writing, but also of promoting their publication. There are real advantages that newspapers or journals derive from bundling writers together. Not only is it good to share resources (e.g. editing, marketing) across writers but having colleagues is an important part of meaningful work. Colleagues provide feedback on your work that improves the quality of what is produced. Helping colleagues and being a part of a team can be as meaningful as the work you are actually doing. Running your own business can be isolating.[ Every](~https:\/\/every.to\/letter~) is a writing collective exploring a space in between these two extremes.\n\n2. ","Norms about how often pieces should be published"," Most newsletters on Substack publish multiple times a week. That is such a large amount of content for one person to create. Personally, I have unsubscribed from most of the Substacks I got excited about because of content overload. It is unclear to me why newsletters feel the need to publish content so frequently, but making good content is a difficult process that takes time. Publishing so frequently can actually be value destructive. This frequency standard seems to be carried over from traditional news outlets. The role of news publications used to be conveying that an event ","had happened",". With social media, publication\u2019s role is no longer just saying that an event happened but providing perspective on what the event means and what the implications are. This type of work takes a lot more time than just stating that an event happened.\n\nContent being published so frequently also destroys the value of previous posts. A reader will not have time to read previous posts if they can not even keep up with all the new content that is being created. While Substack does have archives, I would bet that most readers are not looking back through the archives. It is not surprising that having the expectation to publish so often can lead to burnout.\n\n3. ","Framing the relationship as a consumption good",". Newsletters are currently framed as a piece of content that we consume. We are paying for an object, the writing piece, and then we as readers consume it. When we think of something as a consumption good it is easy to fall into the trap of wanting more. The more there is for us to consume the better! Who wouldn\u2019t rather pay for a publication that creates 4 pieces a week than something that creates 2 pieces a week?\n\n\n","\nUsing the limitations of Substack as a jumping off point, I am going to propose what a different setup could look like. This proposal is about re-imagining what organizations look like and how we can improve on some existing structures. When thinking about new organizations we want to change incentives to improve outcomes for both readers and writers. We want to help writers find situations where they can do meaningful work and be compensated for that work. \n\nA different potential framing is that what we are actually supporting is the creation of knowledge. We invest in someone to do work that otherwise would not get done. The writing piece is just the way that knowledge becomes accessible and shared with others.\n\nThis framing implies that when I support a project it is not because I want a good to consume, but because I believe the work the person is doing is important. Turning that work into something that others can understand is important, but that\u2019s not what I am paying for. It is possible the work gets shared in other ways besides just writing (audio, video, presentations).\n\nChanging the framing from that of purchasing a consumption good to making an investment provides different incentives for the writer. It is less about creating as many goods as possible, but instead they can focus on doing their work as effectively as possible.\n\nOne structure that might provide new opportunities is a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Ownership of a DAO and the work done by the DAO is coordinated using [tokens](~https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/learn\/crypto-basics\/what-is-a-token~). A helpful mental model is that a token is simply proof of an event. What that token proofs can be many different things. In this DAO, ownership tokens are generated when progress on the DAO\u2019s projects is made. The DAO makes its progress legible to outside groups in any number of ways such as blog posts, seminars, audio or video.\n\nPeople can support the DAO and be part owners of the DAO through tokens. Ownership stake in the DAO corresponds to how many tokens you own. Owning tokens will bring with it certain benefits. Owning x% percentage of tokens provides access to a subset of content. It might also give access to events connected to the DAO or access to some of the work that the DAO is doing. People who want to support the DAO or access the content it is creating are incentivized to purchase tokens. Purchasing tokens not only gets you access to some content that you want, but it also means you now own part of the work. \n\nOwnership means that the incentives of readers and writers will be better aligned. Being a part owner means you want the organization to succeed and for tokens to appreciate in value. \n\n***\nFor the DAO to actually be an improvement over current structures it is necessary that the token generation mechanism supports the right incentives. An organization that is coordinated using tokens is not inherently better. But because tokens allow coordination to happen in different ways, they create new possibilities for how an organization might operate. Here are a couple of options for how tokens might be generated\n\n*_Option 1_*. ","A fixed amount of tokens are generated at a fixed cadence",". Core members in the DAO are working on projects. Every month they create X tokens for the work they do. Those X tokens are proof that progress was made on those projects that month. Core members can then sell their tokens to others to be compensated for their work. Owning y% percentage of the total token pool gets anyone access to certain benefits. The token price is initially determined by the core members who are creating tokens. By selling their tokens they are selling their ownership at a certain price. If people are willing to pay more money for the tokens, then the value of the tokens will increase. Anyone who owns tokens can then sell them to anyone else at any price they wish.\n\nUsing a scheme like this could remove the incentive to publish more frequently. The amount of tokens that are generated is fixed. The main incentive is to do work that others deem as valuable so that others want to own \/ support the organization. Others will learn about the work through the content the DAO makes, but making more content does not make the work more valuable.\n\nThis scheme could be thought of as paying a fixed salary. That salary is determined based on how much people are willing to pay for tokens. It removes the incentive to focus on creating as much content as possible because the number of tokens that are generated is fixed. \n\n*_Option 2_*. ","When the DAO makes their work accessible to others, it is created as an NFT (non fungible token)",". This NFT can then be sold to others. You would need to be above a certain level of ownership to interact with the piece (above x% to read the piece, above y% to comment on it). Rather than buying ownership of the entire body of work, others can buy ownership of individual aspects of the work.\n\nIn this setup, value is directly tied to when the work becomes legible to others. While this might seem like it incentivizes publishing more often, it hopefully will not because different pieces can have different values. Since each piece is its own NFT, others can directly signal how valuable they find each piece to be. A piece that people do not value, might never get bought. A piece which people value a lot could increase in price a lot. This would mean it is more worthwhile to publish something really good infrequently than things that are less valuable more frequently. This scheme has similar properties to[ retroactive funding](~https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2021\/11\/16\/retro1.html~) because people are signaling how valuable they think the work is, after it has already been completed. Buying the NFT is subsidizing and supporting future work that is similar.\n\nThis scheme might be quite powerful since others can directly signal which aspects of the work they find to be the most valuable rather than having to pay for all aspects of the work.\n\nImagine you have written a book, rather than selling copies you sell tokens that represent part ownership in the book. Using tokens in this way allows for many different possibilities. You have to own x% of the tokens to read the book. There is some extra content that is only available for people who own above y%. After you have read the book you could re-sell your share if you want. If you are only interested in certain chapters, you might only need to buy those chapters. \n\n[Mirror](~https:\/\/mirror.xyz\/~) is a platform that is making NFT publishing possible. \n\n*_Option 3_*: ","Use tokens to coordinate which work gets done in the future."," The DAO will make collective decisions about what it is going to work on. Everybody who owns tokens in the DAO gets a vote on what work the organization will work on. This incentivizes owning tokens because token owners have a say on what the organization works on. \n\nThis mechanism could be seen as similar to[ Kickstarter](~https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/~). Purchasing tokens funds work. Token owners influence what work gets done by the organization.\n\nThe most successful approach might involve a mix of the different options. Different types of projects might be more successful using one option rather than another.  A hybrid approach could have tokens which determine ownership and coordination in the DAO as a whole, but then some individual pieces are sold as NFTs. Having ownership stake in the DAO gets you access to certain perks and owning some of the NFTs also gets you access related to those specific pieces.\n\n","\nSo how does this new model try to improve upon what Substack has done?\n\n1. Working in an organization with others can alleviate some of the difficulties of creating something on your own. Being a member of a team can also often provide meaning that cannot be gained doing something alone. For some, doing something on their own might be the right solution, but for a lot of others it will be preferable to be a part of something bigger than just themselves. Working with others does incur coordination costs though. The goal of using tokens is to diminish some of those coordination costs. Tokens make it easier for groups to coordinate and contribute in different ways\n\n2. The DAO\u2019s focus is not on creating as much content as they can. The focus is on doing work that others deem valuable. Using tokens historical work\u2019s value may not get destroyed by new content being constantly created. The DAO is building on historical work to continue making progress on their projects. This switch in focus could help decrease burnout by not requiring the constant creation of something new.\n\n3. Using NFTs and tokens allows more precise signaling of what aspects of the work people value. Different people might value different parts and they can directly signal which parts they find valuable and how valuable.\n\n4. Growing the DAO is not only about how many people it reaches but how much each person values it. Substack or Patreon have different tiers, but using tokens allows support to be a lot more fine grained. Someone who values the work a lot more can have a larger ownership share\n\n5. When you make an investment and then own part of something it is easier to justify paying more money. Rather than requiring a small amount of money from thousands of people, you maybe only need to convince a hundred that they want to be part owners of the DAO.[ Nick Quah had a newsletter that he recently sold to the Verge](~https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2021\/09\/hot-pod-the-podcast-industry-newsletter-will-become-the-verges-first-paid-product\/~). If you had part ownership in a DAO, if it got sold you would make some money from that sale.\n\nI started this piece talking about Substack and writers, but it might be clear from my language that I think this DAO structure applies to more than just writers. I believe it could work for many different types of work. It could apply to artists, filmmakers, or even researchers.\n\nUsing tokens to coordinate ownership does not inherently lead to better results. It is critical for the DAO to find a token mechanism that works for their project and goals. In the DAO space there will be trial and error with different structures and the correct structure for different projects will look different. Hopefully though, using tokens can allow for new organizations that create better alignment with the creators and the people who value their work. This alignment hopefully improves the work lives of the people in the DAO by providing a financially stable way for them to work on projects that are meaningful and rewarding.\n\n**__Thanks to Nate Jones, Abby Miller, Holly Ormseth and Jenny Wang for discussions related to and feedback on this post.__**\n\n"],"filename":"substack_limitations_and_dao_possibilities"},{"created":1688540750683,"modified":1688541043425,"title":"A Fair Algorithm is not Sufficient","status":"Finished","tags":["machine_learning"],"blocks":["Seeking a Checklist"],"blocks_text":["\nFor the past two weeks, I have been working through **__Me & White Supremacy__**, Layla Saed\u2019s month long interrogation of white supremacy. I am reading the book, journaling each day and then meeting with a group of co-workers weekly to discuss our experience. While journaling, I noticed my tendency to gravitate toward simple solutions. The chapters about tone policing and cultural appropriation were quite challenging.  I was looking for specific guidelines about what my behavior should look like. A checklist to tell me when something was or was not cultural appropriation. Explicit guidance that I could always follow.\n\nThis is both an unfair and doomed proposition. It is unfair because my actions and behavior are my own responsibility. Asking someone else to inform me of the correct way to act in all situations is unsustainable. Each situation comes with its own intricacies and complications. Just following a checklist will not be sufficient. There will be situations where the checklist leads me astray. Instead it is important for me to process the context in realtime and evaluate the situation in front me.\n\nThe real problem with relying on check lists is that it offloads the decision making process. When I use a checklist I am no longer grappling with difficult questions. The checklist is doing all the work.\n\nAsserting myself, versus taking a back seat in a conversation is heavily dependent on who else is in their room. Making an appropriate decision is dependent on understanding other individuals\u2018 histories and our group dynamic as a whole. If I make that decision using a checklist I am processing information in a different way. Using the checklist means I am more concerned with my actions being perceived as the right ones, rather than having an understanding of the situation. I can say \u201clook I went through the checklist therefore my actions are defensible\u201c.\n\nThese reflections reminded me of Rhonda V Magee\u2019s messages about radical complexity. At a [meditation retreat](~\/writing\/talks\/mindfulness\/med_social_rhonda\/~) I attended earlier this year, she talked about how the world is radically complex. But we have not been taught to hold that radical complexity and examine it. We have been taught to simplify it. To simplify situations so we can run them through a checklist and then make a decision. But this simplification will always lead mean missing part of the full picture. It deludes us that what matters is making the correct decision and not also what goes into that decision\n***\nAfter reading this [article](~https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-020-02003-2~) by Pratyusha Kalluri I am reflecting on how the AI community might be following into a similar trap with \u201cFair AI\u201c.\n\nFair AI research is focused on evaluating algorithms for systematic bias. Is the error rate different for different populations? Does the algorithm use certain protected traits such as race or gender to make a decision? Research about fairness in AI systems has exploded in the past few years. I do not want to downplay the importance of this work. Lots of researchers are asking very important questions that need to be asked. But I do wonder if this work is deluding both people inside and outside of the AI community.\n\nIs it important that we use algorithms which are fair by these definitions? Yes! But does having a supposedly fair algorithm mean it is safe to use? No. Algorithms passing these specific tests are only a small part of the picture. We should refrain from and be skeptical of any checklist that people can use to determine if an algorithm is useful.\n\nThis view of fairness comes from us wanting to move past radical complexity. We tend to gravitate towards simple solutions for difficult problems. While it might be a necessary condition that our algorithm passes certain checks, it is not sufficient. When AI is implemented it will always be part of a larger system. We must interrogate AI in that larger framework.\n\nWe can use a case study to help ground our thinking. Here is a [NY Times article](~https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/24\/technology\/facial-recognition-arrest.html~) about an instance where AI usage went terribly wrong. It led to a man being arrested for a crime that he did not commit. While it is easy to read this article and call for \u201cFair AI\u201c, a fair algorithm would not have solved all of the problems here.\n\nThe article mentions that research has shown algorithms are less accurate for black individuals than for white ones because of bias in training data. But even if that were not the case, and the algorithm had passed the fairness check, AI still would have been misused in this context. Similarly there is a quote in the article suggesting that the problems would be solved if law enforcement bought the good facial recognition algorithms rather than the bad ones.\n\nThe real problems is that the people using the technology have minimal understanding of it. The company that contracts with the police department has no transparency and did not develop the algorithms. The  police officers who were using the output of the algorithm knew nothing about it. They did not have insight into how often it is wrong. When people using the output of an algorithm know nothing about it, the algorithm is more likely to be misused. The people who develop technology are responsible for overseeing how it is used.\n\n***\nEven if an algorithm is fair and the people using it know a lot about it, it might still be a bad idea to deploy the algorithm. It is possible that it will be used to surveil or damage certain populations. Successful development and deployment of AI depends on asking questions not specific to algorithms. It is essential to be asking questions about the system that the algorithm is operating in as well as the algorithm itself.\n\n- Who is developing this technology?\n    - What is their background?\n    - Where other voices involved?\n- What is driving the development of this technology?\n    - What funded this work?\n    - What principles were leading the development?\n- Where will this technology be implemented?\n    - Were the use cases clearly specified by the developer?\n    - Are the developers part of the implementation of the algorithm or only the development of it?\n- How will this technology be used and who will be in charge of maintaining it?\n    - Is the output of the system feed into another system?\n    - Who acts on the output of the system?\n    - How much knowledge do the people that are using the system have about the development of the systems?\n\n***\nWhen we ask these questions about the larger system rather than just the algorithm, we have a better chance of uncovering problems with AI adoption.  The current approach to fairness focuses too much on the internals of the algorithm. The AI community must proactively ask questions outside the scope of the algorithm.\n\nIf we look at some characteristics of the larger AI community we can notice dangerous trends.\n\n- Who is developing Artificial Intelligence?\n    - The Elite! Wealthy people either at large organizations or academic institutions. The field is not diverse and is mostly white and male.\n- What is driving the development of this technology?\n    - Profit! People are developing AI for the benefit of large organizations. Rarely is AI being developed because of the ways it could help people. The focus is on automation. Not how the automation could unlock opportunities for people.\n- How will this technology be used and who will be in charge of maintaining it?\n    - The technology is often being implemented by people who have very little knowledge of it. They often do not know how it works and the potential dangers.\n\nIf AI researchers truly want to see AI be a force for good they need to start working with communities and pushing themselves to do more difficult things. They need to be more aware of larger societal structures and recognize that you have a responsibility for how your technology is going to be used. While research on algorithmic fairness is important, it will never be enough. Adoption of AI in a harmonious and beneficial way is dependent on large contextual questions about complex systems.\n"],"filename":"a_fair_algorithm_is_not_sufficient"},{"created":1688541043382,"modified":1688541194831,"title":"Building Models and the Scientific Method","status":"Finished","tags":["machine_learning","intelligence"],"blocks":["Difficulties with ML","Looking for Understanding","A different workflow"],"blocks_text":["\nIn the past year there has been a large focus on what is wrong with the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Coverage has focused on limitations of current deep learning and machine learning systems. Pieces have highlighted the dangers of implementing systems without understanding their implications or who they are going to impact. These pieces have highlighted areas where these fields need to grow. Machine Learning is still a relatively young field that needs to grow and learn. This piece is going to be a personal reflection on my experience in the field and some of the structural problems that I have not heard people talk about before. I will end the piece with some concrete recommendations about how Data Scientists can change their workflow which I believe will lead to better outcomes.\n\nIf you talk to Data Scientists or ML Engineers you might hear them talk about the different models they are building. They are building models to recommend movies you might like. They are building a new model that will tell you what type of wine you will enjoy. Building a model is a term that has come to be applied every where. But what does it actually mean to build a model? Does it just involve building a system that makes accurate predictions? From my experience in the field, practitioners have defined building a model as creating a system that can accomplish some task on its own. Building a model should be focused on gaining a greater understanding rather than building a system.\n","\nAt times during my short lived career as a Data Scientist I have struggled to be engaged with what I am working on. I have struggled to feel like what I am doing matters. It feels like I am going through the motions rather than  critically thinking. This is an issue that I brought upon myself rather than something inherent of my jobs. But, it is an issue that is exacerbated by current practices in the field of data science.\n\nI was \/ am attracted to the field of Machine Learning because it helps me better understand the nature of intelligence. Studying what makes an intelligent system and how to build intelligence are problems that motivate and inspire me. They are questions that force me to reflect on my own intelligence and life in the world around me. My introduction to the field was doing academic research during undergrad. We were regularly grappling with these questions; What is intelligence and how is it represented? Since I began working in industry my day to day can feel far away from these basic questions.\n\nMy experience of being a data scientist at a corporation has been quite different from doing academic research. While this was to be expected, and there are parts about this that are important, losing sight of these basic questions can be dangerous. Being a data scientist in industry can be limited to taking a known algorithm and just throwing data at it. It is about achieving a high accuracy rather than understanding mechanisms. I was solely focused on building a system that accomplishes a task by putting data into a random forest and maximizing accuracy. Will including these features make our model more accurate? What if I change some of the hyper parameters? I was focused on improving accuracy and had lost sight of what it meant to build a model.\n\nBuilding a model should not mean putting data into an existing algorithm and hoping it has high accuracy. Model building should be a process of trying to understand mechanisms and how they drive outcomes. I was re-introduced to this direction through bayesian modeling and specifically the work of [Andrew Gelman](~https:\/\/mc-stan.org\/users\/documentation\/case-studies\/golf.html~). Building a model that helps you understand the world is a much more helpful direction than focusing on accuracy.\n\nA model that helps you understand the world will be more valuable than a model that can accomplish a task. While automating tasks can save money in the short run, current approaches can miss the larger picture. Rarely do we solely care about the outcome of a specific task. What we actually care about is a larger question, which are specified task is only one part of.\n\nIf we are building a system to predict house prices, our end goal is normally not to just accurately predict house prices. We want to understand what are the factors that drive house prices. Why does one house cost more than another? Why do some houses in different regions cost more? What does differential house prices tell us about human preferences? Can we use this tool to make more affordable housing?\n\nIf we are building a system to recommend vacation destinations what is our actual end goal? It is not to just predict destinations but provide a meaningful service to customers. We want to make it easier for people to find vacations that they will enjoy. We should not focus on achieving a high prediction accuracy but on understanding why do people enjoy certain vacations? Why do different people enjoy different types of vacations? Why would a vacation to Iceland be enjoyable during one time of the year but terrible during another time of the year?\n\nOur desired outcome is rarely accomplished by automating a task. What we care about is making decisions and understanding how different decisions lead to different outcomes.\n\n","\nSo why is data science as a field struggling? Why is it focusing on the short term and the narrow rather than a greater understanding. There is a beautiful simplicity in optimizing a metric. Defining success in terms of error\/accuracy leads us to forget about the larger picture. Practitioners need a better work flow that keeps the larger systems and questions in mind.\n\nData science as a field is missing the scientific method. Rather than forming hypothesis and then testing them, data scientists often just dive in head first. We have identified a task we want to solve and we write some code to create an automated solution. The scientific method though, provides a workflow that keeps the larger picture in mind. It forces us to form a theory about what the underlying mechanisms are and then test them out. The scientific method forces us to build a model. Only with this model can we understand the driving forces.\n\nLet\u2019s return back to our example of predicting housing prices. Rather than taking a lot of data and putting it into an existing algorithm, let\u2019s imagine a different workflow. Without even seeing the data, let\u2019s form a hypothesis. We believe that houses in good school districts will cost more than similar houses in worse school districts. Now that we have a hypothesis about what drives housing prices we can test that hypothesis. If we find it to be true, we will have a better understanding of what drives housing prices. Even if it is false, we have gained more information about driving mechanisms. We will now have on record that a certain hypothesis is false and can test out a new one.\n\nData Science as a field is still young and evolving. We see the promise and potential of automating a task and forget to be systematic thinkers. We forget the larger goals and focus on one metric. There is a metric we can measure, so we optimize it. Using the scientific method forces us to build a model of the world. We have to form hypothesis and then test them out.\n\nSo what would a different workflow look like? Rather than just directly working with data let\u2019s begin by forming some hypothesis. We write down these hypothesis so that we can keep track of them. A great way to form hypothesis is by talking to subject matter experts. If we are creating a vacation destination model, let\u2019s talk to some travel agents.\n\nOnce we have our hypothesis let\u2019s test them out.

When we begin to automate our task we are no longer focused on optimizing accuracy but rather have an understanding of a system.\n\nIt is harder to measure how much of a system we understand than accuracy on a defined task.

Over the past couple of weeks she completed her first round of tests. One of Jenny\u2019s big takeaways was that she should smooth out her studying. Doing a lot of studying in the couple of days leading up to the test is not a strategy for success. The classes that she had put the most time in earlier in the semester, were the ones she felt the most prepared for. This is especially the case if our goal is to learn the material well, but also applies if our goal is simply to do well on the test (which it is currently for a lot of students). \n\nJenny\u2019s experience reminded me and made me reflect on my own history of preparing for exams. Every test that I have taken I have done some version of cramming for. Not only was this a bad technique for success on the test, but it meant I did not learn the material. I also found that cramming increased my stress levels and made me feel more nervous going into the test because I was acutely aware that I could have studied more. Being nervous for a test might be as detrimental as knowing a bit less material. \n\nThe solution of spending more time earlier in the semester so you do not feel like you need to cram is a really admirable one. It is a strategy that does not feel that accessible to me. I also imagine it is a solution that most students would not take. This got me thinking about how I would design a course where students did not feel the need to cram and instead were incentivized to learn the material deeply and dynamically. \n","\nFirst some principles about how I think about the purpose or role of a course in a students education: \n\n* Every course is going to cover some common material for all students. But a good course will also allow students to explore their own interests. The goal of a course is to help students accomplish some goals of theirs. Every student has different goals and therefore the course has to be dynamic enough that different students can have different takeaways. \n\n* Students should leave the course with confidence and excitement. Students should never feel like they cannot succeed. \n\n* If the course has to be graded, it will be possible for every student to receive a top grade. How to get certain grades will be transparent and standards should be very clear to students. Grades should not be centered on scores and rather focused on feedback to help students.\n\n* Students are incentivized during the entire course to do things that will help them learn. If I was teaching a traditional class then I would use grades as an incentive mechanism to help students learn.\n\n* It is important for students to give feedback to the teacher about the class. The class is meant to serve the students and one of the best ways to make sure that is happening is by asking the students directly. \n\n* During the course students will have to interact and work together. The class should help students form bonds with each other and learn to work together. \n","\nNow some design mechanisms I would use in the class to achieve these goals\n* The class would be focused on projects rather than short term problem sets. There would be two large projects. One project in the first half of the semester that involved more guidelines and direction. A second project that is free from and allowed students to go in many different directions. Students would then present their projects. The first project would be presented to small groups and the second project would be presented to the entire class. \n\n* Each project would be individual, but it would involve some collaboration with others. You would get extra points for giving feedback to your class mates on their projects and for receiving feedback from your class mates.\n\n* Each student would get extra points for coming to office hours, or scheduling 1:1s with the professor and TAs. \n\n* There would be auxillary readings that students could get extra points for reading and writing about.\n\n* The in person time of the class is less lecture based. There would be interactive group activities as well as some individual reflections. More traditional style lectures would be made available online if students wanted to use them. \n\n* Spaced repetition would be an integral part of the course. Students would get points for completing their spaced repetition cards each week. \n\n* There will be a bi-weekly survey that checks in with students about how they are doing, what was most helpful and what was least helpful. \n\nThis piece was an exercise in how I would design a class that could still be taught at a modern day university. That means there are a lot of constraints in how the class could be structured. Another separate and interesting exercise would be to design an educational experience without any constraints.\n\nI want to recognize two professors in college whose classes incentivized learning above all else. Both [Ging Cee Ng](~https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/gingceeng\/~) and [Averill Leslie](~https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ave-leslie\/~) taught classes with unconventional formats, but they were two of the classes were I learned the most. A lot of the ideas in this post are inspired by them. \n"],"filename":"notes_on_teaching"},{"created":1688540570718,"modified":1688542063308,"title":"Playing Games","status":"Finished","tags":["learning"],"blocks":["Failures in Colloboration","Games as a learning setting"],"blocks_text":["\nJenny, my wonderful partner in crime and teammate, had her birthday last month. I got her a Nintendo Switch, with the game [Overcooked](~https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overcooked~). Overcooked is a cooking simulation game. You are in a kitchen with other chefs and you have to collaborate to make customers dishes. While simple in concept, Overcooked is quite deep in how it forces you to work together. The levels are set up so that the only way you can succeed is by delegating and working together. This aspect of collaborating is so essential that researchers at [U.C. Berkeley](~https:\/\/bair.berkeley.edu\/blog\/2019\/10\/21\/coordination\/~) actually used the game as a model for building agents that can work with humans. Jenny and I have been playing the game together over the past month and it has forced me to reflect on how I work with other people.\n\nPlaying Overcooked has highlighted some of the ways that I struggle to work with others. During gameplay, I will often just expect the other person to know what I am doing or understand what I am thinking. Rather than communicating what I am trying to do, I just start doing something and then am surprised when the other person does not understand. This is a problem that I also struggle with in contexts outside of a cooking video game. I will expect that the other person is on the same wave length as me, rather than communicating my thoughts.\n\nAnother tendency I noticed is that I break from the script. We will have decided a division of labor that works, but sometimes I will feel like I can do more, and do something else. My teammate is expecting a certain behavior from me, and so even if I am recognizing an extra opportunity to contribute, if I do not communicate it, our system breaks down. Once again, rather than communicating with my teammates, I am just playing my own game and expecting them to adapt as necessary.\n\nI also at times struggle to trust my teammates. I do not trust that they are going to do, what in my mind, is the right thing. I am expecting them to make a mistake or preparing for when they do make a mistake. An essential part of being a good teammate is trusting your teammates and putting your faith in them.\n","\nReflecting on Overcooked gave me a lot of areas that I can grow in all contexts. I believe this is one of the best parts about playing games. While yes, we play games because they are fun and they connect us with others, they can also often be insightful. One of the largest benefits I have gotten out of playing Frisbee is learning more about myself by being on a team. I have learned more about forming an inclusive community and being a good leader. I have learned about creating strong bonds with your teammates and how important it is to become friends with them. Playing frisbee has taught me so much about all aspects of my life, not just the playing sports part.\n\nWhile I have known for a while how much I have learned from playing frisbee, playing Overcooked made me reflect on how the the places I struggle in a game can often mirror the places I struggle in real life. Now that Overcooked made me see that, I also see that all over the place in Frisbee.\n\nIn Frisbee, I also struggle with expecting people to do certain things and expecting people to understand what I am doing. When players do something different than I am expecting, I can struggle. I also often try to do too much when I play Frisbee and sometimes do not trust my teammates as much as I should.\n\nI believe that playing games is an important thing for everyone to do. Whether it is playing a team sport, playing board games, or playing video games. Games give us the opportunity to learn more about ourselves in contrived situations. It is hard to recognize your own weaknesses in your day to day life. It can feel like a falling of you as a person and hard to change. But we often do not feel like that when we fail in games. We know that it is something that we can work on and get better at.\n\nGames also help us recognize that just as I can get better at Overcooked by explaining why I am cooking rice instead of chopping fish, I can also improve other interactions in my day-to-day life by improving my communication.\n\n"],"filename":"playing_games"},{"created":1688541608204,"modified":1688542072688,"title":"What are we looking for in a politician?","status":"Finished","tags":["organization_structure"],"blocks":["Ideology is the wrong place to focus","What makes a good leader","Picking a good leader for government"],"blocks_text":["\nWe have been taught to support political candidates whose ideology most nearly matches our own. While being ideological aligned with a candidate is important, not enough weight is given to candidates other traits. As an organization grows larger, the success of the organization is determined less by the vision or execution of the leader and more by the leaders ability to listen and empower others. The United States political system is so large and unwieldy that the impact of a president is not felt through their ideology but their ability to successfully run a large organization.\n\nDuring primary season I have had so many discussions about which candidate to support. These conversations always center on candidate\u2019s view points about policy. During the Democratic Primary there was a popular Washington Post [quiz](~https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/politics\/policy-2020\/quiz-which-candidate-agrees-with-me\/~) that tells you which candidate you should support. The premise of the article was that through answering a series of questions about different polices, we can identify which candidate to support. This article represents a broader trend in political discourse. All of our discussions are focused on policy.\n\nDuring the Trump presidency there has been a lot written about polarization. Many scholars have highlighted how the U.S. and other Western Countries are more polarized than ever before. This entire discussion focuses on where we stand on a scale going from liberal to conservative. Candidates are boiled down to a point on a spectrum. This person is a socialist, this person is ultra conservative, this person is more centrist.\n\nPolitical ideology is closely tied with personal values. Choosing a candidate that has similar policy ideas to you often means choosing a candidate that has similar values to you. While picking a candidate whose ideology aligns with your own is important, we focus too much on each candidate\u2019s ideology. We determine who would be a good leader based on their idealogy. In a smaller organization the ideology and vision of the leader matters more. For leaders in government there are other factors besides ideology we should be considering more.\n","\nWe are going to step away from government for a second to better understand why an intense focus on policy hides who will actually be a good leader.\n\nImagine we are picking the leader of an organization. The type of organization does not matter, it could be a start-up, a non-profit, a school science project, etc\u2026 We want to pick a leader who is going to make our organization as successful as possible at accomplishing its mission. To start, let\u2019s imagine our organization is quite small, it is only one person. What are we looking for in a leader of our organization? If the organization is just one person, we want someone who has a good vision and is going to be able to execute that vision. I want someone who is a hard worker and who has good ideas.\n\nBut now, let us change the task slightly. We are still picking the leader of an organization but the organization is two people instead of one. While this organization is still quite small, if the organization has two people,  our ideal leader slightly changes. We still want someone who has a good vision, but we also want someone who is good at listening and working with others. We want someone who maximizes the other person in the organization.\n\nNow let\u2019s jump to an organization of 5 people. It is even more important that our leader can listen to others. We want a leader who has good organizational skills and can run a team successfully. The leader has to be good at facilitating group conversations and resolving disagreements.\n\nAs our organization gets larger the skill set of an ideal leader changes. We become less concerned with the individual\u2019s point of view and more focused on how they maximize the entire organization. Imagine an organization of 30 people (still considered small in most places). Our leader needs to be empowering the workers on the front lines to be making smart decisions. The people on the front lines have the most information and a good leader sets up a system so that she can learn from them. In a larger organization it is critical that the leader is good at hiring talent. The larger the organization the more different things matter than the leaders individual opinion. The success of a large organization is not determined by the leader\u2019s vision but by her ability to listen and empower others.\n","\nThe government might be the largest and most unwieldy organization that we have. There is both the federal government and regional governments. The government was built specifically so that all the different parts do not work well together. Regional governments limit the power of the federal government. Our government was purposely divided into different parts so that no one part has too much power.\n\nHistory shows that the structure of government limits our ability to get things done. Barack Obama was in office for eight years and he was really only able to focus on getting one thing done, Obamacare. Our government was built so that it is not easy for everybody to work together.\n\nIf we were starting from scratch, we would think about picking the leader of our government in a very different way. Yes, we would still care about their personal ideology, but we would be less focused on it. There are many politicians who have ideologies that are close enough to our own. Rather than finding the candidate who has the ideology that most closely matches ours, we would be trying to learn more about how candidates operate. We would want a candidate who listens and recognizes their own limitations. A candidate who can admit when they are wrong and hires great staff.\n\nIf we were less focused on ideology and more focused on these other characteristics we might be interested in the following debate questions.\n\n - How do you get information from your staff?\n - How do you handle when someone challenges your opinion?\n - How do you think about who you are hiring?\n - Is there a possibility that some of your policy ideas are wrong?\n\nWe can essentially think about the presidential election as a hiring process. We are hiring a candidate to run our organization. We have a couple of months to learn more about the candidates for the position. We do not only care about what our candidates product vision \/ policy positions are. We also care about how they work with others.\n\nReframing picking a candidate in this way helped clarify a lot of things for me personally. It makes it a lot clearer why Trump is such a bad person to be running this country. Not only are his policy positions detrimental, but he is not a good leader. He can never admit when he is wrong and is very difficult to work with. He is terrible at hiring the right people.\n\nOne last thought. While the ideological views of the leader may not matter as much in a larger organization, I am interested in exploring how it is important to have other people in the organization who are ideological leaders. Other people who are focused purely on ideological movement and driving ideological change. Think about AOC or Bernie. They have played such an instrumental role in moving the democratic party. While that might not be the role of the leader, it is still necessary to empower ideological leaders. I am excited to flesh out these thoughts a bit more.\n"],"filename":"what_are_we_looking_for_in_a_politician?"},{"created":1688542111452,"modified":1688542246750,"title":"Reflections on election season","status":"Finished","tags":["career_decisions"],"blocks":["Harmful Mindset","Looking for design"],"blocks_text":["\nWoof\u2026\u2026 The past couple of months have been such a whirlwind. It has both been quite long and quite short. I guess that is just the way it goes. I have done a bad job of taking time to do personal work. You might have noticed the lack of posts since the end of September. That doesn\u2019t mean I have not been reading or writing. But, I have not set aside the time to take what I have been doing and put it on this website. Over the next few weeks you should start to see a bunch of posts trickling in. I have about six books to catch up on and five papers.\n\nWhile it is still fresh in my mind I wanted to jot down some thoughts about what it was like to be working in politics for my first election season.If you want to check out one of the things I was working on, I built Change Research\u2019s presidential vote model. [Here](~https:\/\/changeresearch.com\/post\/2020-presidential-model\/~) is where we released the model\u2019s predictions. As far as I know it is the most accurate model that was publicly released.\n\nWhile working at Change is different than working on a political campaign, I imagine a lot of what I felt over the past few months is common with all people who work in the political sphere. The basic ethos at our company was \u201cnow is the time to put our heads down and deliver\u201c. This often meant working longer hours or trying to get something out the door even if it was not perfect. A presidential election only comes around every four years. Now was our time to make it count.\n\nThis attitude actually really negatively impacted my work experience. Not only was I feeling less enthused about work, but I think the quality of my work also deteriorated a bit. I am a firm believer that working more hours does not lead to getting more work done. But when there is pressure to get work done, that is an easy margin to adjust on. Engineering work is truly a creative process. It takes time and space to do things the right way. When I am working more hours it can often take me longer to get something done. I do not think the problem through as well and I make more mistakes.\n\nWe were constantly justifying decisions with the following logic:\n> It is fine if this is imperfect right now. Let\u2019s get it out the door and we can make it better later on.\n\nBut this tradeoff was often a false one. Using the imperfect solution led to more difficulties later on and did not actually mean we delivered anything quicker. We were using that logic to justify doing worse work. Going through this election season has been a really good opportunity to explore that tradeoff. In general, I think it is better to take a little bit more time upfront.\n\n","\nDuring the past few months, I was often finding myself drained at the end of the day. I was not excited about going to work the next day and did not have a lot of energy. Part of this can be attributed to the above difficulties. Part of it can be attributed to other organizational frustrations. But a big part of it can be attributed to the lack of design that I was doing.\n\nOne question I constantly return to is \u201cwhat gives me energy?\u201c What are the activities that give me more energy after I finish them then when I started? These are the activities I should be seeking out. As I have grown in my career and shifted from a pure data scientist to more of an engineering role, I found that design is what gives me energy.\n\nWhen I say design, I mean design at any size. It can be the first few thoughts related to a completely new project. Or how to design a quick bug fix. But when I am doing that creative thinking, that is when I have a lot of energy. Recognizing this makes me see the importance of finding design in everything that I do. As I was exploring above, it can be easy to put my head down and just focus on trying to finish something. But there truly is design in every thing that I do, no matter how large or small.\n\nIt is easy when I am frustrated about my current situation to think of grand changes and how they will make everything better. I have found that just a slight reframing or perspective shift can also have a large impact though. And maybe a more meaningful and lasting one.\n\nGoing forward I am going to look for the design and creative thinking aspect in every task that I do.\n"],"filename":"reflections_on_election_season"},{"created":1688542285602,"modified":1688542444241,"title":"Leaving Nielsen","status":"Finished","tags":["career_decisions"],"blocks":["Company Alignment","Company structure and culture","Why I am excited about working at Change"],"blocks_text":["\nNielsen was my first experience working at a full time job and in a lot of ways it was a good one. I learned an immense amount and became a much better data scientist. I met a lot of very smart people who helped me grow and taught me a lot. There were a lot of frustrations though during my time at Nielsen and I thought it would be worthwhile to expand upon why I am leaving. All of these things together made Nielsen a difficult place to work at times. If I had not had such great managers I would have probably looked to leave Nielsen a lot sooner.\n\nThe main driving force behind leaving Nielsen is that the company does not align with my values. I am not sure what the company\u2019s stated mission is, but from working inside Nielsen, I can tell you that Nielsen helps create an eco-system that gives large corporations the ability to take advantage of individuals. While Nielsen, might say that they are helping consumers express their preferences, that is not accurate. Nielsen is funded by large corporations. Because Nielsen is paid by their clients, in the end their main priority will always be making those clients happy.\n\nNielsen provides corporations with the information they need to get consumers to buy more of their product. I believe Nielsen has the opportunity to be a truly amazing company. A company that uses its panels to understand more about the human condition and what drives decision making. Nielsen does have incredible data and that data is very powerful. The power of this data is currently not being unlocked at all. This data is being used to marginally help the revenue of the largest corporations.\n\nDuring my time at Nielsen, I realized how important it was for me to care about the underlying mission of the place I work at. It is important for me to wake up every day and be excited about the company I am working at and the impact that company is having. All jobs will have really exciting parts and parts that are tedious or boring. When the underlying company mission speaks to you, all of those tasks are much more enjoyable.\n\n","\nNielsen was a difficult place to work because of how large a company it was and how hard it was to get anything done. Data Scientists at Nielsen sit so far away from the product. During my time at Nielsen there has been a lot of work to fix this, but this is an inherent problem of working at such a large corporation. There is so much that needs to happen for any change to be realized. With a large company it is impossible to make changes quickly. After David Kenny came in as the CEO, I thought he was saying all of the correct things, but did not see that change filtering its way down to my level. I think this was due to a lack of change at the middle management or upper management level. Here is an [article](~https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/speaking-truth-to-power-reflections-on-a-career-at-microsoft-90f80a449e36~) from James Whittaker that talks about how important it is to have change in the middle leadership of a company.\n\nNielsen is stuck with a culture problem where people are not empowered to make a real difference. There are a lot of great people at Nielsen who say all of the correct things, but overall the company is too large with too much going on. For Nielsen to be successful it is necessary for them to shrink down their scope immensely. They need to put their employees in the best situations to succeed and be empowered. Nielsen is much to centralized as an organization.\n\nI believe that the a company will have the most success when it is organized around decentralized cross functional teams that oversee a project from beginning to end. Currently at Nielsen, different departments over see a project during different parts of its life cycle. When a certain segment of a project is finished, one team throws it over the wall to another department. It would be a much better structure to have cross functional teams that own a product from beginning to end.\n\nPeople talk a lot about work-life balance and Nielsen has a great work life balance. Nielsen allows employees to work from home and has very good hours. I believe less focus should be on work-life balance and more focus should be on work-life integration. Your work should give you energy and make you thrive in the other parts of your life. You should not feel the necessity to separate the two and protect one from the other. At Nielsen it does not seem like most people are passionate about their job and that their job is gives them energy. This is why they find work-life balance to be so important. When you are not passionate about your job, you need to ensure a work-life balance. On the other hand when you are excited about your job, your job will give you energy and make all the other parts of your life better. People are not passionate at Nielsen because it is difficult to be passionate about consumer insights.\n","\nFrom the above it might be pretty clear about why I am so excited to be working at Change. Change is different from Nielsen in all of the aspects I have talked about above. I am extremely passionate about improving american democracy and helping democratic candidates make better decisions using data. Change is a start-up where everyone works together and sits close to the product. All of the people at change are extremely passionate about what they do and care a ton about the company\u2019s mission. Change is literally the size of one cross functional team. I could not be more excited about starting this new chapter in my journey.\n\n"],"filename":"leaving_nielsen"},{"created":1688542456784,"modified":1688542585340,"title":"Switching from Change Research to Whisper","status":"Finished","tags":["career_decisions"],"blocks":["Why I wanted to leave Change","Search Criteria","How I decided to join Whisper","Time at Whisper"],"blocks_text":["\nFor the past half year I have not been posting here as frequently. I have not been reading papers, typing out full book notes or doing as much reflection writing. The main catalyst for this change was a job transition that I made. At the beginning of February I started working as a Data Scientist at [Whisper.Ai](~https:\/\/whisper.ai\/~) after leaving [Change Research](~https:\/\/changeresearch.com\/~). \n\nThis project \/ website always provided a nice place for my intellectual energy to go. When I was frustrated about work or felt like I was not getting enough out of it, working on this project provided a nice outlet. For my first half year at Whisper, I have not felt as much of a pull to work on this project. \n\nI have wanted to write something about why I left Change and how I approached my job search for a while. It also feels important to reflect on why I have been working on this project less and what my time at Whisper has been like so far.\n\nOne valuable way I have learned a lot is by reading articles \/ pieces from other people who work in tech. I have learned about project management, coding best practices, communication and what a successful company looks like. Reading pieces written by people at other tech companies,  made it clear that some tech companies have really figured out an organization and structure that helps them be successful. Neither Nielsen or Change Research (CR) felt like that. People at both companies did not spend a lot of time thinking about how they worked. \n\nAt CR in particular I was spending a lot of my time trying to improve the way that we worked. I was working to implement better communication and project planning. I really enjoyed doing that work and was doing it because it felt like the most impactful thing I could be doing. Improving planning or communication can have a much larger impact than just writing code. But at CR it did not feel like anyone cared that I was trying to do that work or felt it was important. That obstacle was really disheartening. \n\nAt CR it did not feel like I was having a meaningful impact to bring about the world that I want. One of the main reasons I joined CR was because I was excited about the potential impact I could have there. I was excited about helping liberal candidates win elections and enact change. But the longer I was at CR the more clear it was that I was helping support a harmful system. A system predicated on beating a foe, rather than helping people in need. A system that did not see individuals but rather broad generalizations of people. That type of system felt actively toxic to me and not one that I wanted to be in. \n\nPeople are CR were not interested in questioning what their impact was. They accepted the assumption that polling was good and polling for all democrats was good. But it never become apparent to me that polling was actually a good thing. Did running polls help candidates win elections? As an engineer \/ data scientist it was pretty apparent to me that a poll was a terrible product. The data that was collected from the poll was quite valuable, but then the way it is turned into a final product stripped it of almost all its value. Rather than building machine learning models to help target voters, we created a lossy summary called cross tabs which then had to be manually interpreted by an individual who might give the campaign some useful information. \n\nWhen CR was founded, the goal was to disrupt the polling industry. And maybe doing online polling at the time was really a disruption. But in 2020, the way to really make advances in the field would not be to improve upon polling. It would be to use that some data in different ways. I could write a full piece on all the things wrong with the polling industry (why do people focus so much on random sampling and nobody talks about how turnout uncertainty is one of the biggest impacts on poll accuracy) but it was disheartening to work on what felt like a bad product. CR was working on delivering a bad product cheaper rather than creating an actual good product\n\nWhen I joined CR I was committed to being there until after the 2020 election. After the 2020 election I was going to evaluate if it was somewhere I wanted to stay long term. Post the 2020 election it did not feel like CR had a plan for what the company should work on or how it would grow. That also meant it was unclear to me how I would continue to grow at CR. \n\nAll of these things made it feel like it was the right decision to start looking elsewhere for a new job. \n","\n\nAt the beginning, I was unsure what I wanted out of my next opportunity. When I was moving to CR I knew I wanted to work at a start up. When I was leaving CR there was part of me that thought I might want to work at a big tech company. After talking with a former colleague of mine about his experience working at Google, it seemed like working at a big tech company would not be a great fit for me. At large organizations there is a lot of bureaucracy. Being happy is so dependent on the project you are on and a lot of the work is maintenance work rather than really exciting stuff. \n\nEarly on in my career I want to emphasize having a diversity of experience. Being in many different situations and different roles helps me understand what is important and what impacts my happiness. Being at CR and Nielsen helped me understand so much what I want in a job but also what I do not want in job. Working in a new space also helps me continue to build the skill of ramping up and contributing to a project you do not have previous expertise.\n\nI decided to be less focused on the product space of the company and to focus on the people at the company. The people that I am working with on a day to day basis have the largest impact on my happiness. There are so many different projects I could be working on that I would find immensely interesting. Focusing on people rather than product made the job search a little challenging. It meant that when I was looking at potential companies I had to dig deeper on the people who worked there. Companies do a lot of marketing about their product but not as much marketing about their people. This meant I cast a wider net and used interviews to get a better sense of the people at a company. \n\nI was also interested in not working on a traditional SAS product. There are many reasons why there are so many successful SAS companies. Software is a really good business model. I was curious to explore working at a company that is not a software company and understanding the challenges that entails.\n\n","\nAfter my search I was deciding between offers from both [Dover](~https:\/\/www.dover.com\/~) and Whisper. After taking sometime to consider both options, or even neither option, it felt like working at Whisper most aligned with what I was looking for. \n\nDuring the interview process there were a few people at Whisper who I was really impressed with and excited about working with. It felt like being at the same company as these people would present the best opportunity for me to learn and grow. \n\nI was really excited about the impact of building a better hearing aid. My father has severe hearing loss. I know how hard that is for him and how much a hearing aid helps. While his hearing aid helps him, there is still a long way to go. It is noticeable how much his everyday life has been impacted as his hearing capacity has diminished and how much harder it is to interact with others.  Providing a better experience to people with hearing loss is something that is hugely impactful. \n\nMy role at Whisper was also going to be different from my previous roles. Most of my previous roles were some combination of a machine learning or data engineer. At Whisper I am the only data scientist and am actually in the product organization rather than the engineering organization. At first this was a source of some nervousness but I grew to be excited about the new opportunity this would entail. My role involves helping to change our culture around data and we use data in the organization. I have a lot of latitude to work on what I think is important and to help make important product decisions. \n","\n\nMy first half year at Whisper has been really enjoyable. I have been working quite hard, and it  feels like I have grown a lot while meaningfully helping the company. I have felt a lot less existential career angst and that is probably why I have been working on this website less. There are a few people at work who I have learned a lot from and who I really enjoy working with. With both my other jobs I knew at this point already that I probably wanted to leave but it does not feel that way at Whisper. \n   \nA lot of my time has been focused on building the necessary data infrastructure. That means setting up data pipelines and our data warehouse. I have been also balancing that with getting shorter term wins using data as it becomes available. Since there was no data scientist before me, a lot of the companies habits and culture were built in a world where data was not available. Making changes to culture is difficult, so just creating infrastructure is not enough. This means there is not a set of tasks that I need to execute on, but rather I need to work with teams to tease how data can be helpful to them. \n\nI really believe in the company direction and leadership at Whisper. The leadership has shown the ability to adept and make smart decisions. I believe Whisper is going to be quite a successful company and I am excited to be part of that journey. Trusting the company leadership and direction reduces so much mental burden on a day to day basis. \n\nEven at Whisper I still have trouble connecting to the impact of my work. It is not always clear how my work improves someones hearing health and therefore their lives. But every now and then I get a glimpse. I see when analysis helps us improve the product and how that will have a real impact on users.\n"],"filename":"switching_from_change_research_to_whisper"},{"created":1688542624183,"modified":1688542821350,"title":"How Do I Allocate My Attention?","status":"Finished","tags":["eka"],"blocks":["The most important part of my day","How to have more good days","Current State of the World","What works well","What does not work well","What can I change","How is this more than just a Task Manager?","Next steps"],"blocks_text":["\n\nThe first thing I do when I open my laptop is my most important task of the day. I plan out how am I going to allocate my attention for the day. This planning determines how the rest of my day goes. If I have clear focuses and direction, the rest of my day can be calm, efficient and peaceful. Sometimes when I devote less energy to planning and leave ambiguities, I will be playing catch up the rest of the day. I will be constantly re-organizing what I want to work on and will often spend my energy on things that I probably should not have.\n\nMy most valuable resource is my energy. When I allocate my attention to the correct places, my days feel rewarding and full. I leave the day with more energy than I started and I accomplished tasks that are important to me. When my attention is scattered across a number of different things, my energy depletes quite quickly. Context switching is a demanding activity.\n\nIt is important I segment my time between planning and execution. I find it difficult to be both executing on a task and doing planning at the same time. Similar to how it is difficult to write and plan a piece at the same time. It is a best practice to outline the writing, and then execute. This segmentation of time manifests globally for my day and locally with a given task. This is the reason I try to plan my day out at the beginning. It is also the reason I like to spend five to ten minutes at the beginning of any task sketching out my execution steps on a piece of paper. \n\nWhen I have done the necessary amount of planning, execution feels like a breeze. Even the hardest tasks feel accomplishable. But most of my days do not feel like this. About one to two days a week do I hit the sweet spot. Most days my mornings start well but then my afternoons often become distracted and energy draining. It would be really nice to turn more of my days into those energy increasing days were I accomplish my most meaningful tasks. \n","\nUpping the percentage of my days that are energy increasing is one of the most important things I can do. It will make accomplishing tasks that are important to me easier.  Increasing those days will require some changes in my habits and processes. \n\nAfter talking with [Andy Matuschuk](~https:\/\/andymatuschak.org\/~) about some of my struggles with energy and attention allocation he suggested I look into **__Programmable Attention__**. Programmable Attention is using a system to direct your attention towards high priority tasks. Moment to moment it is difficult and intense to decide where to allocate your attention. Instead of always making that decision, you can set some parameters \/ guidelines about how you want to make those decision in general. \n\nIt is desirable to not be making attention allocation decisions in the middle of my day. Consider the difference between emotions in the heat of the moment versus when there is space to think. In the moment it is easier for emotions to be really strong. To get angry or upset and act in a way that you are not proud of. Later, when you are calmer and have more space, it is easier to recognize that you are not proud of how you acted and that you should have done something else. Programmable attention is similar. In the middle of my day it is easy to pick low impact \/ easy tasks or to let my attention get hijacked by something with a false sense of immediacy. Having a system that helps me stick to my principles for how I want to allocate my attention will help me spend my time inline with my values. \n\nAndy has written [some notes](~https:\/\/notes.andymatuschak.org\/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma&stackedNotes=zJrfPCbY7GcpV9asEc8NTVzXTAV4TvRFMuY6~) himself about programmable attention. Ian tay\u2019s [intro to programmable attention](~https:\/\/www.iantay.dev\/post\/programmable-attention\/~) is also a really good explainer. \n\n","\n\nLooking at the current state is always helpful when working towards improvement. Here is a breakdown of my current planning process and how I determine what to focus on.\n\nMy planning work is done in [Roam Research](~https:\/\/roamresearch.com\/~) Roam has a built in ","TODO"," functionality to create tasks. All of those tasks are listed on one page in reverse order of when they were created. I leave that page open on the right side of my screen in Roam at all times. Tasks that get added to this list are mostly important tasks that I have to do for work. I try to keep this list short (under 10 items) because having a lot of items can be overwhelming. Smaller tasks and tasks not related to work rarely make it onto this list\n\nAs I mentioned, at the beginning of the day I create a list of all the things that I want to do that day. This list includes both things for work and things not for work like, cooking, exercise or reading and writing. I will pull tasks from my TODO list and add them as well. Once I have everything I want to accomplish I sequence the tasks assigning a number to each of them. I then start with my first task. \n\nWhenever I start a task, I try to spend a little bit of time planning the scope of that task and how I want to accomplish things. I either do this directly inline in Roam or sometimes will do it on my [Remarkable](~https:\/\/remarkable.com\/store\/remarkable-2~). \n\nThis process is one that I have come to after some iteration with other processes. There are a number of things that work well, but some things that could be improved. \n","\n\n-  My mornings are highly productive. I often put my most meaty and rewarding task in the morning and am able to work on it undistracted for a long period of time. There are a few reasons I think my mornings go so well.\n1. I have just planned out my day and defined one task to work on. I am then able to work on that task for an extended period of time without distraction\n2. My energy level at the beginning of the day is probably at its highest\n3. There are fewer external distractions in the morning because the company I work for is based on the west coast. \n- Using my remarkable to take planning breaks is a really successful tactic. This will either happen right when I start a task or maybe ten minutes into working on a task.  \n\n","\n\n- My afternoons are often really low energy. I spend time floating around between slack, email and other low priority tasks.\n- Switching between tasks is a place where my attention gets taken up. When I switch between tasks often things that I had not planned for attract my attention.\n- Tasks related to work get over prioritized. I spend more time then I want working on a deliverable for work rather than on thinking or writing or reading. There is more of a draw to work on these things because there is a deliverable. \n- There is a relatively high cognitive load of managing this todo list and making sure I do n0t forget to do things\n\n","\nI am a huge believer in using tools \/ the environment to nudge you in the correct direction. I have found that a distraction free space is critical to my ability to focus. Similarly, deleting most apps from my phone makes it a less distracting tool. The tools that I use have a direct impact on how I spend my time and what I create. In this direction, I think there are improvements I can make to my space through out the day. \n\nRoam is the software tooling that helps me organize my attention. I enjoy using Roam because it makes some organization a lot easier. In general, using a software tool is promising because it reduces the amount of cognitive work that I have to do. Once I have said this is how I want things to work, it will remember that. Just as spaced repetition is possible without using software, managing my attention is also possible. But software has the potential to make it a lot easier. With space repetition, All I have to specify is that I want to remember something and then it does the rest. Programmable attention is a bit more complicated, but I believe it could work similarly. I could specify this is how I want to allocate my attention and then the tooling would help me do exactly that. \n\n","\n\nIt is easy to think about attention solely in terms of tasks that we want to accomplish. In this piece I have mostly focused on ideas related to a productivity. But I believe the scope of this tool might be larger than just a productivity tool.  In addition to helping me accomplish tasks this type of tool might: \n- Help me better prioritize things that are actually important to me \n- Help me build creative ideas spaced out over time\n- Help me know when it is time to abandon a project or something is not as interesting to me anymore.\n\n","\n\n1. Roam has built in functionality called the [Delta scheduler](~https:\/\/roamstack.com\/an-introduction-to-roams-delta-function-spaced-repetition\/~). The Delta Scheduler lets you schedule items to appear later in your notes. I am going to explore using the delta scheduler. \n2. Eventually I will  probably build my own application that helps me with this. Allocating my attention is one of the most important things I can work on and so having software that works for me seems like some of the best usage of my time. \n3. I also want to look into research about energy and attention allocation. Research showed that spaced repetition is a good way to learn things. I am sure there is research that has documented some best practices for attention allocation.  \n\n"],"filename":"how_do_i_allocate_my_attention?"},{"created":1688538796889,"modified":1688543036681,"title":"From Here to There: Learning Chinese, Small Steps and Crypto","status":"Finished","tags":["crypto"],"blocks":["Taking Small Steps","Step 1: Moving from a few tiers to infinitely many tiers","Step 2: A subscription whose price fluctuates and that can be resold","Step 3: A subscription with many different offerings rather than one offering"],"blocks_text":["\nIn the summer of 2019 I took a trip to China and Japan with Jenny and her family. During the trip I met Jenny's extended family, her grandparents, aunts and uncles. Both of Jenny's parents immigrated to the United States for graduate school. While we were in China I was basically unable to communicate with members of Jenny's extended family besides acknowledging their presence. Whenever we had meals Jenny had to translate everything for me to follow the conversation. Jenny's family members went out of their way to make me comfortable which I really appreciated, but sometimes I felt a sadness that I was unable to communicate with them and express my gratitude.\n\nEven before that trip to China I was interested in learning Chinese. Months before the trip I started using Duolingo to try picking up some basic competency. Learning a different language is something I have always struggled with. In school I switched the language I was studying multiple times because it always seemed easier to start from scratch then really progress with one language.\n\nLearning Chinese is one of the most meaningful ways I could spend my time, yet it is a task that I still have made no progress on. It would be so rewarding to be able to communicate with Jenny and her parents in Chinese. I would love to express my gratitude to Jenny's extended family and converse with them. At the same time, the idea of learning Chinese is overwhelming. It feels like such a large task that will take so much time and work. The hugeness of the task can make it difficult to even get started on it.\n\nTo achieve something difficult it is helpful to have small intermediate goals to make the task feel more manageable. Breaking the task down into smaller steps makes the transition path a lot clearer. It gives actionable steps that I can take today to start learning Chinese. It is important to feel like I am building momentum and that I am making progress. Those smaller tasks \/ goals also give me a way to calibrate and change my learning plan as I make progress.\n\nThe vision of being able to communicate with Jenny's family in Chinese really motivates me. I need to keep that vision front and center as I figure out small steps to get more there. I do not need to be fluent in Chinese in the next year or two. I want to start marking progress on the task so that in four to five years I might be conversational. Making such a large change happens through sustained effort and small incremental changes to get from here to there.\n\n---\nCurrently, there are many technologists who praise blockchain technology (sometimes referred to as \u201cweb3\u201d) as the next big paradigm. They believe web3 will create a new internet that gives power back to users and gets rid of centralized platforms. Crypto evangelists paint a very compelling picture of how blockchain technology will create better outcomes for all people. When I read some of these pieces, I can feel an excitement growing in me about what the future of the internet might look like. \n\nThis compelling picture of the future is a big reason lots of people are moving into the crypto space. (Well, that and because people have started making a lot of money in the space.) This vision has inspired me to write about how organizations could be funded differently creating a different incentive structure using crypto ([A Different Funding Model](\/a_different_funding_model)). My interest in crypto is sparked by how I could use the technology to build organizations that improve my own work life and the work life of many others.\n\nThis picture of future organizations is quite different from how companies and funding works today. Since the future vision involving crypto is so different, it can difficult to understand what these changes would mean in practice. How would they actually work? Crypto writng does not always do the work of bridging the gap between where we are today and how we get to that future vision.\n\nIn hopes of clarifying what this future might look like, I  am going to break down the steps of getting from where we are today, to the ideas I proposed in this piece ([Substack Limitations and DAO Possibilities](\/substack_limitations_and_dao_possibilities)). Breaking down the transformative change into a few steps makes it easier to wrap our heads around concepts. It forces a clearer articulation of what is actually changing, how to achieve those changes, and what might be the benefits of those changes.\n\nPreviously, I proposed a DAO that creates content and is funded through tokens. I used[ Substack](https:\/\/substack.com\/) as a jumping off point and then came up with a new structure. Now we are going to take small steps to get from substack today, to the DAO idea I suggested.\n","\n\nCurrently, creator subscriptions like Substack or[ Patreon](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/) often have a few tiers. There is often a free tier where you only get some content, a paid tier where you get most of the content, and a super supporter tier.\n\nThis tiered structure is valuable because each supporter values the content differently. Currently, tiers work by having additional content at each tier. A higher tier is more expensive because you receive more content at that tier.  Here is an example of how tiers might work in practice. We have four people\n\n* Person A who values it at $1 a month, \n* Person B at $4, \n* Person C at $8 \n* Person D at $20\n\nAnd Tiers:\n\n* Tier 1 is $0 dollars for some free content\n* Tier 2 is $5 dollars for the majority of content and the free content\n* Tier 3 is $10 dollars for all of the paid content\n\nEach supporter will get put into a tier based on how much they value the work\n\n* Tier 1 has A, \n* Tier 2 has B and C \n* Tier 3 has D.\n\nEach person gets matched to the tier that most aligns with how much they value the content.\n\nIn this type of structure having more than a few tiers is basically unfeasible. It means the creator needs to slice their content in a lot of different ways and can make the options for a supporter complicated. I have not seen any set-up that has more than three tiers.\n\nHowever, with only a few tiers, both the creator and supporters may be missing out. The creator is not necessarily capturing all the value they are creating. Person D values their work at $20 dollars but is only paying them $10. Person D might be really happy with this situation because they are getting something they value at $20 dollars for only $10, but they might be even happier if there was actually an option for them to get more at $20 dollars.\n\nWhile a couple of tiers is better than no tiers, there is still loss with such a small number of tiers. We could improve on this by having more tiers. An ideal scenario would have no value lost if there were infinitely many tiers. Supporters no longer have to bunch into tiers but can pay exactly how much they value the content.\n\nWith the current structure of paying more to receive more content It is impossible to achieve infinitely many tiers. Instead, infinite tiers can be achieved through selling ownership in the work. Rather than paying to consume what someone is creating, you would be supporting them by becoming a part owner in their work. Supporters are investing in the creator. Each supporter can invest as much as they want.\n\nThis new ownership structure means supporters get value directly proportional to how much they pay. If you pay $20 you get twice as much ownership than when you pay $10. Having ownership is valuable because you can later sell that ownership or because you might have more voting influence when the creator makes decisions. Voting influence seems foreign when it comes to creators but it could be as simple as helping determine the topic of the next article or podcast episode.  Creator's will have to make decisions about what having ownership in their work means. It seems likely that different levels of ownership might still come with some benefits (e.g. Own above .01% to get early access to work or own above 1% to get access to discussions with the creator)\n\nSwitching to a structure of supporters buying ownership in the creator's work creates infinitely many options for how much to support. Supporters have  more options in terms of how to support the work. Creators will capture more of the value they are creating\n","\n\nIn our current Substack and Patreon world, the creator determines a fixed value that their work is worth. Every month supporters pay $5 dollars to get access to the work. The price of $5 remains constant. It is constant regardless of how many other supporters there are. This structure makes sense because one person being a supporter does not interfere with someone else being a supporter. Everyone can access the content and one person accessing it does not impact others ability.\n\nIf creators are selling ownership in their work, that same relationship of each supporter not impacting each other does not hold. If one supporter owns a certain part of the work it is not possible for someone else to also own that same part. We have moved from a world of infinite resources to a world of limited resources.\n\nIn this world of limited resources, the price of ownership is no longer solely determined by the creator. If people are willing to pay more for ownership, the price of ownership will increase. This means the price is determined by the demand of supporters instead. At the beginning a 1% ownership might be worth $100 dollars. But if there is more demand for that ownership through supporters, it could increase to $1000 dollars. This increase in price especially makes sense if the creator is working on something that builds over time. It also makes sense if ownership gives access to scarce resources like the creator's time.\n\nSince supporters are buying ownership, they can also sell that ownership. This means that if the price of the resource goes up both the creator and supporters receive monetary benefit. This ability aligns supporters and creators because they both want the value of ownership to increase.\n","\n\nIn our current world, every supporter gets the same return when they support a creator. Each $5 dollar subscription brings the exact same benefits. Another step would be to allow different bundles. This means that even at the same price point supporters can receive different things. Rather than supporting all of the creator's work a supporter can directly say I want to support this section of your work. This section of your work is what I value and so I am going to support this part of your work.\n\nFor supporters today, there is an inability to support only certain aspects of a creator\u2019s work. Supporting them means paying one fixed fee that supports all of their work. But a supporter might only really care about one aspect of their work. It would be beneficial if the supporter could pay less and only receive the work they actually value. Supporters in this future world will have options to only support the work they deem valuable. This could mean that some supporters will no longer be priced out by having to support the entirety of the work  This gives supporters more options.\n\nAllowing supporters to only pay for certain aspects of the work may also help creators capture more value since some supporters will now longer be priced out. It also gives a creator direct signal on which aspects of their work others find the most valuable.\n\n---\nTaking steps 1, 2 and 3 brings us to a completely different place than the current creator and supporter relationships. Creators sell ownership in their work which supporters can buy. Supporters can purchase as much or little ownership as they want. \n\nSo why is this new relationship potentially better than the one we have today?\n\n* Supporters have a lot more choice in how to support. They have more price points and can support only specific parts of the work.\n* Supporters have the opportunity to make money from their support.\n* Creators are capturing more of the value that they create.\n* Since supporters have the opportunity to make money, it is more palatable for each supporter to give more money, meaning there can be fewer supporters. With fewer supporters a creator can have more direct interaction with their supporters. It is possible to directly talk to them or give them presentations.\n* The creator and supporter having ownership in the same asset means their goals are aligned. They both want the value of ownership to increase to receive a payoff.\n\nHopefully by taking smaller, more digestible steps, I have helped bridge the state of our current world to the one crypto enthusiasts envision. This bridge has hopefully given us the ability to conceptualize a future system without having to dive into the technical details of crypto. Crypto is the technology that could underpin this future system, but it is not critical to the conceptual understanding.\n\n---\nCrypto enthusiasts are so excited about how the technology will take us from the world we are in today to their future vision. But why us it crypto technology that uniquely enables their vision? One argument is that crypto makes this future vision possible because it has trust baked in. Trust is part of crypto because using cryptography to coordinate the buying and selling of ownership means every transaction can be verified by anyone.  It creates a decentralized[ ledger](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ledger) which lists every transaction that happens. Any time anyone buys or sells ownership it will be recorded in this ledger. This decentralized ledger means there is no centralized failure point anymore.\n\nFor the type of creator and supporter relationship I have outlined above to actually happen there are a few necessary ingredients:\n\n1. A technology that orchestrates the buying and selling of ownership. It needs to allow people to buy different amounts of ownership and to allow that ownership to only be in certain parts of the work. Ideally this technology is user friendly, easy to use and transparent.\n\n2. Supporter trust. For supporters to put their money into that technology they have to trust it. They have to trust that the asset they are paying is worth something. That it will not be stolen from them and that they have control over it.\n\nIf we believe that crypto is a technology which brings both 1 and 2 then it makes a lot of sense to build this vision using crypto. But I find it hard to believe that crypto is the only technology that can actually bring supporter trust. There are other ways to build trust that do not involve decentralized ledgers. Supporter trust might be mostly dependent on who the creator is and their public record. Another way to achieve supporter trust could be through some simple and minimal legal contracts. Similarly, centralization can actually be helpful when trying to create trust. When a creator is on Substack or Patreon I feel comfortable giving them money because I trust those platforms.\n\nThe decentralized nature of crypto might actually in some ways impede trust. There are many examples of trust being created through a centralized platform. Uber created enough trust for us to get into cars of random strangers. Airbnb created trust for us to go stay at homes of random strangers. Uber and Airbnb created the technology to allow a new transaction to happen while also createing trust through ratings, reviews, and their brand. Both Airbnb and Uber make creators (drivers and hosts) do certain things before being on the platform.\n\n---\nWhat determines the success of a platform or technology is its ability to let users easily achieve their goals. Crypto might be the best technology to create the future internet that we want because of how it handles trust. But there are also other ways to also create trust and something built using crypto can still be untrustworthy.\n\nI find the most inspiring part of the crypto movement to be its vision for what the future might look like. This vision has brought a lot of capital and creativity into the crypto space. But just because something is using the blockchain does not mean it will inherently create this vision. If people moving into the crypto space are more focused on capital than they will make decisions focused on capital.\n\nThe key to fundamental change is to focus on the vision of the world we want. With that vision in mind we can start taking small steps towards that future world. We can ask which technologies enable that vision rather than assuming a specific technology will solve all problems\n"],"filename":"from_here_to_there:_learning_chinese,_small_steps_and_crypto"},{"created":1688543093098,"modified":1688543263731,"title":"My interest in Machine Learning","status":"Finished","tags":["machine_learning"],"blocks":["Interests outside of work","My initial attraction"],"blocks_text":["\nOne of my strongest correlations with feeling down or out of sorts is whether I have been reading a  book recently. I will notice that I feel a little out of sorts for a day or two. I will then also recognize that I have not been doing any reading on my kindle of late. Its hard to disentangle whether being down is causing me not to read or whether I am down because I am not reading. It does seem like   reading helps me have a balanced head space though. Reading gives me a topic that is not my work which I can reflect on. \n\nHaving projects or curiosities I am exploring outside of work is important for me to feel balanced. When I spend too much time thinking about work it becomes hard to settle my brain down or reach a place of calm. Reading is one of the ways I can achieve that balance. Another one is spending time with friends. Generally when I am in a rut it also correlates with me spending less time being social and connecting with others.\n\nIt is important for my well being that I am balancing my work life with other pursuits. Reading and being social are two mechanisms that help me live a balanced day-to-day life. It also feels important for me to have some intellectual curiosities that I am building on outside of work. This can manifest as certain topic that I am trying to read a lot about or learn more about. It is rewarding to have one theme that I am making progress on or understanding more about. \n\nMy first curiosity that was in this category was Machine Learning. During my junior year of college my friend sent me a [Wait But Why series on Artificial Intelligence](~https:\/\/waitbutwhy.com\/2015\/01\/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html~). Reading those pieces from Tim Urban really struck a cord with me. Urban did a wonderful job of both highlighting the importance of the topic while also outlining the unknowns. During that time I was interviewing at different trading firms to go work in finance and decided to bail on that and see how I could explore ML.\n\nMy interest in ML was so strong that to date I have oriented a lot of my career around it. I got a job doing ML adjacent research in college before becoming a data scientist professionally. Even while I was working as a data scientist full time, I still spent time reading ML papers outside of work. Machine Learning fully captured my intellectual curiosity.\n\nBut recently, I have spent much less time thinking about Machine Learning. It is less clear that I want to orient my career around it and in my free time I am mostly exploring other topics. I am hopefully that by examining this transition in my curiosity, I can understand more about myself. Some questions I am interested in understanding are:\n- What makes a topic something that I am attracted to? \n- Why did Machine Learning go from something I was spending a lot of time thinking about to something I am not thinking about anymore?\n","\nAn important place to start this journey is understanding why I was so attracted to machine learning in the first place.\n\nMachine Learning felt more exciting than anything I was learning in any of my computer science classes or economics classes. In 2016, as a junior in college all my classes felt so divorced from something that would actually impact someone\u2019s life. I was learning the theory of software construction and the impact of the federal interest rate. These topics did not motivate me or engage my curiosity. They felt like solved problems where someone was just transferring their knowledge to me. Machine Learning though felt completely different. It was new territory where we were still figuring out the implications of the technology.\n\nMachine Learning as a field felt like it was speaking to some of the most fundamental questions I could be interested in. How do we build a system that is intelligent and can accomplish non trivial tasks? I was thrilled by the idea of understanding what makes a system intelligent. We still lack such a grasp on where human intelligence comes from and how human intelligence is different from other species. Studying intelligence gets at fundamental questions of our world and has implications for how I live my life.\n\nAs I was first learning about Machine Learning it was immediately evident how impactful the technology could be. ML can be used in many different ways to make lives better. It can automate tasks that people do not want to do. It can answer questions that humans cannot on their own. It can make predictions about the world. Machine Learning is able to leverage data in a way that is so different from humans. ML can be so impactful because it is an intelligent system that operates in a different way than humans. This potential impact of ML as a tool, enthralled me. I wanted to work on something that had a huge ability to help people.\n\nIn 2016, ML was making huge strides every year. Performance on certain datasets was improving so quickly. New techniques were getting developed that far outstripped the state of the art. Problems that seemed impossible merely years before were being solved. It felt exciting to be working on something that was getting better so quickly. That by doing research and working in Machine Learning there was the opportunity to really push the state of the art forward. \n\nMachine Learning stood out in contrast to everything else I was learning about in my classes. It felt like a topic that was exploring fundamental questions about how we move through the world. It was a technology that had an opportunity to improve how we live our lives and that was making an immense amount of progress quite quickly.\n\n***\nSitting here in 2022, the field of machine learning is in a very different place than it was in 2016. ML has graduated into its teenage years. It is being used in many different places and there are plenty of people making lots of money using ML. Neural networks have shown the ability to accomplish many different tasks and large language models have amazing text generation capabilities. \n\nML\u2019s success has in some ways made the research field quite narrowly focused. Most research that is happening is related to deep neural networks and how to make step wise improvements on them. Since we have lots of evidence that NNs are quite successful more research has been focused on going down that same path. It is much less risky to work on something that has a track record of success. If you have to publish research papers every year, then it makes sense to spend your time on something that is already proven.\n\nBut my attraction to the field was not about making iterative improvements on NNs. I am attracted to the field because I want to better understand intelligence. Improving NNs does in some ways help us understand intelligence, but that is not the framing motivating the research. I can understand why papers do not have that focus since it is not defined what it means for a paper to help us understand intelligence. When evaluating a paper it is much harder to determine if a paper actually pushes that understanding forward than it is to look at an improvement in a few metrics. When I am in the trenches of day to day work though, it is necessary for me to have a larger motivation I can tie the work to motivate me to push through the less desirable parts of the work. I would be more attracted to ML work if it worked harder to tie the content back to understanding intelligence. \n\nWe could compare the success Machine Learning has had with neural networks to the idea of a [resource curse](~https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Resource_curse~) for developing countries. The resource curse theory posits that when a country is abundant in a natural resource, in some situations this can actually be bad for growth. The country might become over reliant on that one resource which means it lacks a diversity of industries. We might think that similarly, ML has over indexed on one research paradigm. ML as a field is mostly focused on how can we use neural nets and make them even larger to solve even harder problems. It is possible that creating large NNs will really push the field forward, but it is not the type of research that I am most interested in. \n \n***\nThe success of ML means that it is being used every where in industry. Almost every tech company uses ML in different parts of their business. The ecosystem around using ML has become so built out that it can be utilized by any software engineer. In just a few lines of code you can train models on datasets.\n\nFrom my experience, successfully leveraging ML models is not dependent on a deep knowledge of ML algorithms. Being knowledgeable about algorithms is helpful, but often the key constraint is the quality of the data. If you have data with really high signal, then training the model is the easy part. But with data that is noisy, there is very little improvement you can make by messing around with the algorithm a lot. \n\nWhile in academic research, the dataset is often fixed, in industry there is the opportunity to shape your dataset. Academic research has defined datasets and then researchers work on getting better scores with that fixed dataset. But in industry the dataset is often quite malleable. Additional data can be collected, the data can be formatted in different ways or the problem you are trying to solve can even be changed. Successfully leveraging ML in industry is often determined by your ability to frame the problem in the correct way and collecting the necessary data rather than a knowledge of algorithms.\n\nAs a field, there should be more focus on how to create the right data to solve a problem. Working in industry my success is not dependent on knowing the cutting edge of research and being able to implement it. It is based on making smart decisions about what data to collect and how that data relates to the problem we are trying to solve. This aspect of doing ML work gets talked about a lot less but is quite important.\n\nIt feels disheartening that the work that gets valorized and focused on is not the same as the work that makes a day-to-day difference. It can also be hard to be in a field where there is not as much scholarship about the things I need to learn and improve at. While I actually really enjoy thinking about how to collect the necessary data and how to make a system legible in the form of data, that work currently is not considered Machine Learning work. \n\n***\nWriting this piece helped me understand my feelings about ML and why I might be less interested in it. My fundamental attraction to understanding intelligence is still there, but now it feels like Machine Learning is not the field to approach that question. I have been recently reading more about neuroscience and biology, which might approach these questions more directly. While ML is quite impactful and will continue to be, from my experience the most impactful work in industry that is related to ML is not currently considered ML work. I would be excited about research focusing on how do we make systems legible in data and how we can construct some theories about this that are widely applicable. ML is not moving as quickly anymore and that might be why some of my interest has gone into technologies like crypto and quantum computing which feel like they are just at their beginnings.\n\nFrom these reflections it also has become evident that I have some opinions about what directions ML should move in as a field. The research community should aim to have more diversity and people trying out many different approaches. While NNs have been quite successful it is not clear that they are the only path forward. Also, our understanding of NNs is still so limited. It might be worthwhile to push people towards work understanding NNs rather than improvement. I find a lot of the work from [Distill](~https:\/\/distill.pub\/~) particularly inspiring. \n\nI would love to read other\u2019s opinions about their relationship with the field of ML and where they see the field heading!\n","",""],"filename":"my_interest_in_machine_learning"},{"created":1688543285230,"modified":1688543477498,"title":"Meditation, Skill Building and Parallel Processing","status":"Finished","tags":["learning","meditation"],"blocks":["Duration of  a sit","Conscious vs Subconscious ","How we simplify experience"],"blocks_text":["\nMy junior year of college is when I started meditating. Growing up I was always someone who had way too much energy. I had trouble sitting still in class. In second grade my teacher would let me get up and walk around the classroom because it helped me stay focused. During the weekends my parents knew they had to take me outside and run me around if I was going to fall asleep at night.I was attracted to meditation as an opportunity to calm myself down a little bit. That tendency with my physical energy could also apply to my mental state and I would have trouble calming my mind down. Since starting meditation in 2017, it has helped me out a lot and I have received a bunch of benefits from it. \n\nMy practice has mostly been daily 10 - 20 minute sits, but recently Jenny and I decided to try a meditation retreat that involved some more intensive practice. On our three day retreat, which is still quite short by meditation retreat standards, I spent some time thinking about how the duration of a practice changes the experience. The retreat is a much longer period of time than my normal daily sits. Why are longer sits and a whole day of practice so different from my daily practice?  \n\nMy experience was that the difference can not be explained simply by the fact that the retreat is longer and therefore I was sitting for more time. I felt that the first ten minutes of a 30 minute sit were different from the first 10 minutes of my ten minute sits. A 30 minute sit at the beginning of the retreat also felt quite different from a 30 minute sit in the middle of my work day. One 30 minute sessions seems to impact me differently than three ten minute practice. I started reflecting how each of these experiences might feel different because I am impacted by what happened before and what I am anticipating to come after the sit. \n\n***\nThinking deeply about this time aspect of meditation made me realize how similar meditation can be to other tasks. It is harder to meditate for a longer period of time because I am doing a task that takes energy. Most tasks become harder the longer I am working on them. Meditation is no different. It is more difficult to sit for 30 minutes than for 10 because I am using up the energy that I have. Focusing my attention on my breath is a difficult task because it is so different than what I do normally. Meditating, similar to a lot of other tasks requires energy to be completed.\n\nWhile I did not identify this model of energy usage with meditation, it is a model that is quite intuitive with other tasks. At the end of a day we need to rest because we have depleted our energy during the day. We cannot exert our bodies physically indefinitely. I can run for a certain amount of time but as I use up my energy it becomes harder and harder to keep running. My body needs to take a break to rest and recover. This model is more intuitive with physical exertion, but we also know it applies with mental tasks as well. The longer I am at work, the more drained I become.\n\nFor these tasks that require energy to be spent, we have learned that you can get better at them through practice. If I want to become a better runner I have to run regularly. Overtime as I run my body adapts to become better at running. I am able to both run for longer and at a quicker pace. Meditation actually also follows this trend. The more I meditate the easier it becomes to meditate. I am able to both meditate for longer and have higher quality meditations. \n\nMeditation is a task similar to many others, that requires energy to be used and that we get better at the more that we practice. All of these other tasks though we think of as skills. Getting better at running is a skill. Playing an instrument is a skill. It is not immediately clear to me what the skill I am building is when I meditate. I meditate because of the benefits on the rest of my life. I am not meditating to get better at the act of meditation. One explanation could be that meditating is improving my ability to pay attention, but I find that meditation is about a lot more than just focus. There are meditations that are not about focus but instead are about showing gratitude or being loving. As I mentioned my prime motivation for meditating was not focus but finding a place of calm.\n\nI believe part of the reason I have trouble viewing meditation as a skill I am building is because it impacts characteristics of my personality that I do not normally think of as skills. When I talk with other people about their ability to pay attention, they talk about it as a fixed thing. That some people have short attention spans and others have longer ones. Some other personality traits are thought of as even more fixed than attention. We speak as though it is fixed that some people are kind and others are less kind. But maybe just like getting better at running, or playing an instrument, being kind or paying attention is actually a skill that we can cultivate.\n\nSo this leave me wondering, why do we think of some qualities as fixed personality traits, but we recognize other as skills that need to be worked on? \n","\nSkill building, getting better at a specific task, is a discipline that has been studied in depth. There are many different skills whether it is playing a sport, playing an instrument, cooking or baking, where a lot of resources have been developed about how to grow. From my own experience, the following model is helpful when I am thinking about how to build a skill.  \n- When I am first starting out, I am attempting to do something novel. This task is not something I have done before and it is quite difficult. I might not even be successful in accomplishing the task. \n- As I do the task more and more, it becomes easier. Soon my body just starts doing the right thing without devoting as much conscious energy to it. My attention or cognitive load can be focused on something else because my body just does the task instinctively. \n- Eventually this task becomes something I can do without even thinking about it. The completion of the task has been completely moved to my subconscious. No part of my cognitive energy is spent on accomplishing the task.\n\nAs we gain mastery over a skill it changes from something we spend a lot of cognitive energy on to something that happens almost completely in the subconscious. We know this to be the case with some of our most basic functions. We do not remember it, but at first walking and talking took a lot of cognitive energy. Eventually they moved to the subconscious. An example of something we might remember more clearly is learning to type. At first it took a lot of energy and focus. Now my hands just press the correct keys without thinking about it at all.\n\nA possible explanation for why our bodies function in this way, moving tasks from the conscious load to the sub conscious load, is that our conscious load is fixed. We have a fixed amount of conscious attention. If I am spending my conscious energy on making my fingers press the correct keys, then I cannot focus on what I am trying to write. A helpful metaphor could be to think of our conscious energy a single linear process. Our sub conscious energy thought can parallel process. While our conscious energy can only be devoted to one thing at a time, our bodies can do many things at the same time by utilizing our sub conscious. We actually do know that our bodies are doing many things all at the same time. We can hear things, feel things and be thinking all at the same time. Being able to move tasks out of our conscious energy and into the subconscious actually might be necessary for us to do a lot of the complex tasks that we do on a day to day basis. If we had to devote conscious energy to everything we do, it would be impossible for us to function. \n\nOur experience is so dominated by what is happening in our conscious attention that it dominates our perception of self. In my experience, I am rarely consciously choosing feelings. Instead an event happens causing some feelings to appear in my conscious attention. Those feelings appear as some fixed part of me, not something that is malleable. But it is also possible that reacting to an event is a skill that has been moved to my subconscious. It would be quite energy intensive to be consciously deciding how I feel every single movement. The aspects of our selves that we think of as traits are the same as other skills, they just are mostly in our subconscious already. \n\nIf what we think of as traits are actually internalized skills, how we think about identity can actually be changed. We do not have these fixed aspects of our identity. There are aspects of our identity that have been internalized deeply into our subconscious. Changing them can be difficult because they are entrenched in the ways we process the world. In order to change them the trait or skill has to be brought out of the sub conscious and into the conscious. Once it is in the conscious then it can be worked with and adapted.\n\nThe focus of many meditations is to do exactly this, bring things that are normally in our subconscious into the conscious awareness. The most classic example of this is focusing on your breathing. Normally breathing is something that is not a part of our cognitive energy, but meditation asks us to put it there. There are other meditations that focus on hearing or touch sensations which are also often in the subconscious. Practicing with the breath can make it possible to do the same with feelings and thoughts. When a feeling or thought pops out of the subconscious into the conscious we learn that we do not need to become attached to it. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this act of moving things from the conscious to the subconscious is really important. It is what allows us to do many complex tasks and to build skills. But this also can have negative impacts. It means we can develop patterns or habits that we are not even aware of. If these habits are harmful then it can be really hard to change them and we might view them as fixed aspects of who we are.\n\n","\n\nThe ideas in the section above are merely a theory based on my experiences with meditation and building skills. Our conscious experience is a linear processor and it only has a certain amount of capacity. To allow that capacity to be spent on solving novel problems in new situations, we move a lot of processing into the sub conscious. Moving tasks into the subconscious is what gives us the ability to do multiple things simultaneously or complex tasks.\n\nOur most basic functions have been moved to the subconscious. The ability to breathe, walk, talk and even think are all happening below our perception. They are so fundamental that it is helpful that we do not devote conscious energy to them. \n\nThis insight about movement between the conscious and the subconscious might be able to help me answer some of my questions related to meditation and time. What happens before a moment in time and what I anticipate to happen in the future impacts my experience of present moment. In reality, I can only focus on my breath for one moment. If I can only be present for a moment, what happened before that moment or what might happen after should not impact my ability be present. But processing every single moment in its entirety would be overwhelming for my single conscious processor. That means our experience of the present moment has to be simplified. Two brief theories for how we simplify our experience: \n- One way to simplify the amount of processing we have to do is through ","time smoothing",". We process things that are nearby in time in similar ways. We are generally not going to be happy immediately after being sad. It takes time for the way we are processing actions to change. This is why what we anticipate to happen impacts our experience of the present moment and what just happened impacts our experience.\n- Another way we make it easier to process the present moment is by ","pattern matching"," it to other similar moments. We compare this moment to a history of moments. Our feelings are then determined based on the outcomes of previous moments that were similar. This is why our history can impact the way we respond in a lot of very strong ways.\n\nIt is really important that a lot of the processing our body does happens outside the realm of our conscious awareness. This allows our conscious awareness, our most valuable resource, to be used in the highest leverage way. Without this, it could be really difficult for us to handle novel situations or do complex tasks. But, the fact that so much of our processing happens at a level we are not aware of can also be detrimental. It means we use heuristics that are not always true. I find it really helpful to recognize that my subconscious processing is not a fixed trait of who I am, but rather something that can change. I have found meditation to be a really helpful tool for making me aware of my subconscious processing. \n\nI recently finished reading the book [Other Minds](~https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Other-Minds-Octopus-Origins-Consciousness\/dp\/0374227764~). The ideas in here are not directly taken from it, but it would be silly not to recognize that the content of the book has influenced these thoughts. I highly recommend it! \n\nThese thoughts are also inspired by conversations with Jenny about cognitive burden.\n\n"],"filename":"meditation,_skill_building_and_parallel_processing"},{"created":1688543519563,"modified":1688543662392,"title":"How public opinion changes","status":"Finished","tags":["intelligence"],"blocks":["Morality on a longer time scale","The role of our political system"],"blocks_text":["\nFrom last week\u2019s post on meditation, it might be clear that I spend a lot of time thinking about individual change. During my life I have changed in a number of ways and I will continue changing. When thinking about these changes I do think about them in negative and positive lights. Certain behaviors are ones I want to cultivate while others are less desirable. \n\nA large determinant of who I am is the context that I live in. This might seem simple but it has ramifications for my understanding of self. My believes are strongly shaped by both the ","place"," and ","time"," that I live in. If I grew up in a different country my believes would be quite different in a few different ways. If I grew up in the same place but during a different time period my believes might be even more distant from my current ones.  \n\nSince I am influenced by the society I grew up in, to understand myself it is necessary to understand that societal context. Our society is not constant, it is something that is constantly changing. Many of the large changes in society have been technological or scientific. Those technological changes have improved the living conditions of many people. Reading [Hans Rosling\u2019s](~https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hans_Rosling~) books [Factfulness](~https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better\/dp\/1250107814~) and[ How I learned to Understand the World](~https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-Learned-Understand-World-Memoir\/dp\/1250266890~) make it immediately clear how much living conditions have improved over time. I am also a big fan of [Jason Crawford](~https:\/\/rootsofprogress.org\/~)\u2018s work on developing a field of progress studies to understand how these technological changes happen. While these technological changes have drastically impacted the lives we live, I am also interested in exploring the related topic of how society\u2019s morality or believes have changed. \n\nEven if we only reflect on a recent time scale, society\u2019s morality or ethics has changed immensely. Our views on sexual orientation, religion, marijuana, and criminal justice have changed quite drastically during my life time. If you take a slightly longer period of time, it becomes even clearer how much views have changed. The moral landscape when my parents were born feels so divorced from where it is today. Looking over a hundreds of years it becomes quite clear that society\u2019s morality has always been changing. Since society\u2019s morality has always changed, there are believes we have today which are going to be changed in the future. \n\nI find this framing of what moral believes we have today, that we might look back on poorly as a really helpful question to think about behavior change. I first saw this question asked in a blog post (which I can no longer find) by [Beto Dealmeida](~https:\/\/blog.taoetc.org\/~) about why he is a vegetarian. Recently, Holden Kaurnofsky has also been writing about this question. Holden is exploring a system for how we can live lives that will not be impacted by the ways morality is going to change that he calls [\u201cfuture-proof ethics\u201c](~https:\/\/www.cold-takes.com\/future-proof-ethics\/~)\n\nWhen discussing how society\u2019s morality has changed, it is easy to see all changes as positive. We have slowly increased the scope of [who is included in society and tried to protect more beings from harm](~https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Expanding_Circle~). I personally believe these have been positive changes, but I have grown up in a society post these changes. It seems theoretically possible that we could have large moral changes that are actually negative. There is not some definitive force that means all of the changes we are going to make will be good ones. We know that individuals sometimes change in harmful ways so why couldn\u2019t a society as well? When thinking about shorter time periods there are absolutely examples of negative changes that a society underwent which caused harm.\n\nThinking about how society\u2019s morality changes leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions. Two ones that immediately jump out are:\n- How do big moral changes happen? What causes them?\n- What makes a moral change positive? \n\nIf we understand the possible answers to these questions a little bit better then we can work to make positive changes happen sooner \n\n","\nGrowing up, both my school and my parents repeatedly taught me the importance of politics.  I was told that it is a personal failure not to vote. Winning or losing an election has a large impact on the society we live in. If one party wins our society will be vastly different than if the other party does. This opinion was so strongly ingrained in me that it influenced my decision to work at the political polling start up [Change Research](~https:\/\/changeresearch.com\/~). I believed that one of the most impactful things I could work on was helping better candidates win elections.\n\nWorking at CR gave me the opportunity to see how much politicians are focused on winning elections. Doing polling it was quite transparent how connected what politicians say is to what people are saying in polls. During the election cycle candidates want to understand what messages connect with their supporters. They do testing to identify what message they believe will help them win the election. Using that optimal message crafted from testing, they hopefully win the election. Once they are in office their focus shifts toward enacting policy that aligns with their crafted message. If while they are in office they do something completely different than what they said,they will no longer be in power after the next election.\n\nSince politicians continually have to win elections, a lot of what politicians do in office is directly dictated by public opinion. At the surface this observation is quite straight forward. It is our representative democracy working as intended. What it means though is that the actions a politician takes in office are not necessarily a reflection of their personal views. They are forced to keep their actions in line with public opinion. While, the outcome of each election is still quite important, it implies that large structural change does not happen based on the outcome of an election. Change happens when public opinion move which then impacts elections. \n\nSince large changes to society do not happen at the level of individual elections, the best use of my time is not necessarily helping certain people win elections. If I really want a more equal distribution of wealth then I should focus my energy on changing public opinion. If large scale wealth re-distribution was really popular, then it would happen. The best way to achieve large societal changes is by moving public opinion. \n\nWhile the outcome of one election does not mean large structural change, politicians still have quite a large role in making that change happen. Politician\u2019s role is through being influential public figures rather than enacting policy. Public opinion is influenced by politician\u2019s opinions. People are influenced by the President\u2019s opinion. The biggest way for politicians to have an impact is not through passing an unpopular bill, but by using their platform to shift public opinion. Other public figures can also serve similar roles as politicians. Influential individuals have the ability to change people\u2019s opinions which might eventually change our society.\n\nUnderstanding more about how our political system works helped me see that large societal changes are driven not by the outcome of elections, but by shifts in public opinion. This might feel tautological, but large moral changes in society happen through changes in public opinion. Changes do not happen due to one individual or a group of individuals (at least in the present version of the United States) acting in discordance with the rest of the public. For a large change to happen, many different individuals each have to be convinced of the change.\n\n***\nIf we believe that moral changes in society happen when public opinion changes, our focus should turn to understanding how public opinion shifts. Answering this question is not something that can happen in the span of an essay. It is most likely not even a question that we can currently answer well (more on that later). There are a few pieces of insight that feel like good places to start. As I mentioned earlier in this piece it seems likely that influential public figures have a role in shaping public opinion.\n\nOne theory for how public opinion changes is through generational replacement. [Generational replacement](~https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Generational_replacement#:~:text=Generational%20replacement%20is%20a%20theory,their%20different%20circumstances%20growing%20up.~) suggests that people who are a similar age will have somewhat similar views, because their views are shaped by formative experiences that happen when they are a certain age. Then as the younger generations replace the older generations in share of the population, the overall public opinion will shift. [This piece from the Economist](~https:\/\/www.economist.com\/graphic-detail\/2019\/10\/31\/societies-change-their-minds-faster-than-people-do~) has some nice graphs showing examples of what might be generational replacement. Generational replacement feels like a theory that has a fair amount of explanatory power and matches my understanding of cognitive development. Our believes are much more likely to undergo change when we are younger. As we get older we become much more steadfast in our believes. Large scale change does not happen through changing people\u2019s minds but rather new generations replacing older ones. This theory might also explain why moral change can feel like it takes a really long time. \n\nWhile generational replacement is a compelling theory, it does not feel complete. From my own experience, there are examples of people changing their mind. In the graphs from the Economist piece, the graph on marriage equality shows both characteristics of generational replacement but also broad opinion change. That for certain topics, there has been a large change through many individuals changing their existing opinions. \n\nAn appealing theory to explain opinion change is the impact of exposure. Opinions are changed only when an individual is directly exposed to an issue in a different light. Someone\u2019s opinion on abortion is only changed when they have an experience with it that impacts them. An opinion on gay marriage might change through meeting and interacting with gay people. When I have a personal interaction with an event, that is the most likely way that I will see it in a different light and might change my opinion on it. I am less likely to change my opinion on something based on hearing an argument, then a direct experience with it. \n\nUnderstanding how public opinion changes is really important for us to move society in ways we believe to be beneficial. If societal change only really happens through generational replacement, then change is going to take time. It would make sense to spend energy on influencing people while they are younger and not to spend resources on trying to change older individuals opinions. If exposure is the best way to change individuals minds then we should not spend our energy trying to argue with others but rather promote policies that bring about exposure on their own. \n\n***\nIn this piece, I have mostly focused on public opinion change as a positive force to improve our society. I state that one element of our society slowly improving is public opinion changing. Without going into too large of a digression, I want to acknowledge that there is no reason our society or public opinion will always move in positive directions.  That is actually one of the reasons why understanding public opinion is so important.\n\nI believe the ways society has changed are positive because I live in the present day. It is easy to tell stories about history that portray society as having made progress. But that type of framework is not a strong foundation. It does not give us something tractable for thinking about change moving forward. In Karnofsky\u2019s piece he suggests a framework for thinking about positive change using [Sentientism](~https:\/\/www.cold-takes.com\/future-proof-ethics\/#sentientism~). That we should focus on capacity for pleasure \/ suffering for thinking about moral progress. Good changes are ones that increase pleasure and decrease suffering for any creature. \n\nUsing Sentientism as a foundation seems directionally correct, but I think there is an aspect underlying Sentientism that Kaurnofsky does not discuss. Our morality \/ ethics is directly tied to our scientific understanding of the world. Sentientism only became a framework as we understood more about how other beings experience the world. Sentientism would not exist without an immense amount of scientific understanding. A lot of moral changes in our society have happened in line with a deeper scientific understanding.\n\nOur individual visions of the world are biased to prioritize our own experience. We experience our lives as though we are the center of the universe and our needs matter the most. Through scientific discovery we have learned that this is not an accurate representation. That I am no more important than anyone else. That other humans have the same experience as me and have just as much right to seek pleasure and diminish suffering. Only through this understanding our we able to overcome our biased visions.\n\nWhile this idea is not fully formalized, I believe there is an important connection between moral progress and scientific understanding. Positive moral progress aligns itself with an accurate understanding of the world. A better understanding of the world allows for moral progress. Scientific progress is a key element of societal opinion change. \n\n\n***\n\nSome types of changes to our society are predicated on large scale public opinion changes. Without people changing their opinions we are not going to have a more equal distribution of wealth or a more sustainable relationship with the environment. There are instances in history where there has been large changes in public opinion. But also some instances where the change has taken a really long time or maybe still has not happened. Understanding public opinion and how it moves feels under studied. It is a complex topic that does not fit neatly into one of our existing **__academic fields__**. \n\nIf I were to study public opinion changes I would start in the following places:\n\n- Polling has done some important work to chronicle public opinion. At a baseline, we need  to measure what public opinion is and see when it changes. Political polling is too focused on winning elections making it short sighted. We need to poll in a more dynamic way focused on understanding.\n- A really important place to focus my attention would be on how people form believes. What makes someone form a believe and how could they change that believe?\n- Public opinion is not only made up of individual believes though. Individual believes combine in complex ways. How does one person\u2019s opinion impact others? Do certain groups opinions move in tandem? Are there certain individuals who have a lot more influence on others opinions? We should probably be thinking about public opinion as a complex network.\n- I would also focus my attention on studying historical examples of public opinion change. What are the biggest examples of change and how did they happen. What are examples where change took longer or has not happened? What are the commonalities and differences among these examples?\n\n"],"filename":"how_public_opinion_changes"},{"created":1688544168695,"modified":1688544352069,"title":"Research Bias","status":"Finished","tags":["organization_structure"],"blocks":["Other metrics besides wealth","Academic research incentives"],"blocks_text":["\nDuring my undergraduate studies, I was frustrated by how much my economics classes focused on wealth. The success of an intervention would be measured by how it impacted someone\u2019s wealth. While increasing someone\u2019s wealth can have positive impacts, I felt like only looking at that metric misses a lot. There are many ways someone\u2019s life might be improved that are not related to their monetary wealth. The argument for using wealth was that it is easier to measure. It is harder to reliably measure mental health or happiness. \n\nMy interest in pushing for other metrics besides wealth, comes from my specific experience in the world. In my life, if you only look at wealth, there is a lot of richness that is missed. Changes in my income have had a smaller impact on my well being when compared to other changes. My experience is not shared by everyone though. I grew up in a family that never struggled to provide for me. When I receive marginally more money, it does not make much of a difference. For others, an increase in wealth can have a much larger impact than it does for me.\n\nWhat I find to be meaningful research is impacted by my own experiences. Using other metrics besides wealth is probably still an important thing to push for. But due to my own experience with wealth, I am probably over indexing on my own experiences when thinking about research directions.\n***\nSince my personal wealth is much higher than what I actually need, I donate around 10% of my income to charity. One charity that I have been particularly impressed with is  [GiveDirectly](~https:\/\/www.givedirectly.org\/~). They have a clear and important mission, cash transfers to people in need, and do an impressive job of measuring the impact of their programs.  \n\nRecently, a friend told me about a study from the [Happier Lives Institute](~https:\/\/www.happierlivesinstitute.org\/~) which found that another charity, [Stronger Minds](~https:\/\/strongminds.org\/~) is ","12X"," more effective that GiveDirectly. Strong Minds provides group therapy to women in Africa who might be struggling with depression. I was really excited about these findings. These findings lined up with some of my pre-existing believes. They show that by focusing on mental health there is a way to improve people\u2019s lives dramatically. After a quick glance, I added Stronger Minds as one of the charities I donate to. \n\nAs a few weeks went by the nagging suspicion kept popping up that it is hard to believe  that group therapy is ","12X"," more effective than cash transfers.  The findings were aligned with my existing biases so it was easy for me to just accept them. But ","12X"," is such a huge difference. And ","12X"," more cost effect at what? I decided to look deeper into the research. \n\nReading HLI\u2019s work in more detail made me reflect on how much my existing world view can impact my understanding of new evidence. After doing the reading, I do not have confidence that we can currently compare the impact of cash transfers with psychotherapy. It actually feels a little irresponsible to say Stronger Minds, is 12x times more cost effective than GiveDirectly. Since, the majority of people who interact with HLI will not dive deeper than that broad takeaway, I am disappointed in HLI. That result is on HLI\u2019s front page, which implies they would only make such a statement if they are quite confident it is accurate.\n\nI spent a few hours across a couple of days reading HLI\u2019s findings ([summary](~https:\/\/www.happierlivesinstitute.org\/overview.html~),[ cash transfers](~https:\/\/www.happierlivesinstitute.org\/uploads\/1\/0\/9\/9\/109970865\/the_cost-effectiveness_of_cash_transfers_at_increasing_subjective_well-being_and_affective_mental_health_oct21.pdf~), [psychotherapy](~https:\/\/www.happierlivesinstitute.org\/uploads\/1\/0\/9\/9\/109970865\/cost-effectiveness_analysis__group_or_task-shifted_psychotherapy_to_treat_depression_oct21.pdf~)) to understand more about their approach. To evaluate the interventions they used two measures, Subjective Well Being (SWB) and Affective Mental Health (mHA). SWB involves directly asking individuals about their well being. MHa is based on asking questions related to common mental health disorders such as depression. For both interventions they do a [meta-analysis](~https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meta-analysis#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20is%20a,have%20some%20degree%20of%20error~) by combining results from many different papers. Their outcome of interest is standard deviations of improvement  as a result from group psychotherapy or a cash transfer. \n\nAs I first started reading HLI\u2019s work it made more sense how they could find such a large effect. Psychotherapy being 12x more ","cost effective"," can be broken up into two components. HLI estimates group therapy is 3x more beneficial than cash transfers while being 4x less costly. While a $1000 transfer will cost more than $1000 dollars (~$1200), delivering group therapy costs only about $300 per person. The finding of 12x ","cost effective"," feels more plausible knowing that a large portion of it is due to therapy being cheaper than monetary transfers.\n\nLooking deeper at HLI\u2019s estimates though is where my confidence in their findings began to fall apart. As I mentioned, to estimate cost effectiveness they estimate both the benefit and the cost. Their key estimates can be seen in the table below. The confidence intervals on these estimates are quite large, especially the psychotherapy ones! The authors actually state that their estimate for how much more cost effective psychotherapy is could be anywhere from 4x to 27x. That is a really huge range! There is more variation in their estimate of the benefits so that\u2019s where I focused my energy next.\n\nThe amount of variation in the measured benefit of these interventions makes me believe that HLI\u2019s confidence intervals might be too small. To estimate the impact of both interventions HLI runs some simple linear regressions. For psychotherapy they regress benefit on years since intervention with an intercept term. For cash transfers they regress benefit on amount of money and years since receiving the transfer. The graphs for both of these regressions can be seen below:\n\nLooking at both of these graphs, it immediately jumps out how noisy they are. Across all of the different studies, there is so much variation in how much benefit participants get. The other thing that jumps out is how little data there is  further in time from the intervention. There are a lot of data points for both interventions in years 1 and 2. As more years pass though, there are almost no data points. Since there is so much noise in the early years and only a few points further out, our regression estimates will be largely driven by those points that are further out. If those points were removed, the results would be quite different. This means the generic confidence intervals that come from a simple linear regression will be incorrect since those points are having such an outsized impact. \n\nIt is easy to justify not removing these outliers because they make the regression result line up with our basic intuition. It makes sense that both interventions should have less of an impact the further away we are from the intervention. It also seems logical that a larger cash transfer should have a larger impact. For both regressions, if we removed the outliers the results of the regression would be less intuitive. For cash transfers, if we remove those couple of studies there would be no relationship between time since intervention or amount of money and benefit. In the psychotherapy papers the authors even acknowledge how sensitive their estimate is to these outliers\n\n> Are our estimates sensitive to outliers? Baranov et al., (2020) has an unusually long follow-up. If we exclude it from our analysis the estimated total effect is reduced by around half.\n\nAfter looking at the graphs above, my confidence in the results of the papers completely disappeared. The findings are built upon both of these regressions. If the results from these regressions are changed, then the whole paper is quite different. Using the graphs, it feels really difficult to compare these two interventions with a lot of confidence. Seeing all that variation makes me think we need to understand some of the factors causing those differences before we can feel confident estimating the impact of the intervention broadly. \n\nBesides not having faith in the key regressions, there are a couple of other things that made me question my believe in the research.\n\nThe studies that the authors use are from many different countries, looking at many different different populations. The same intervention will have a very different impact depending on which population it is targeting. Psychotherapy will be more effective for some than others. Similarly, $1000 dollars will have a different impact depending on the person. It is not clear to me that these two interventions were being applied to the same population or how the findings from the paper would apply to other populations.\n\nWhile I was doing more reading I realized that when HLI states the 12x more cost effective number, it is not directly stated what the charity is more cost effective at. Their statement implies that StrongerMinds is a 12x better charity than GiveDirectly, but that depends a lot on what the goal of the charity is. StrongerMinds is directly focused on improving mental health through psychotherapy.  While cash transfers can improve mental health their are many other positive impacts they could also have. \n\nIn a lot of ways it feels like the research was set up to find that group psychotherapy is more cost effective than cash transfers. The outcome of interest is the one that psychotherapy is directly targeting. StrongerMinds probably applies their intervention to populations where they think it will have the largest impact. Since GiveDirectly [measures their success differently](~https:\/\/www.givedirectly.org\/research-on-cash-transfers\/~)  they are probably not targeting their interventions to have a large impact on mental health.\n\nWhile I really appreciate HLI\u2019s approach of measuring an interventions success using a mental health measure, I feel uncomfortable with the general statement they made comparing the cost effectiveness of the two interventions. To confidently make a general statement about cost effectiveness, it feels important to look at a few different outcomes of interest. There might be other outcomes we care about such as physical health, children\u2019s health or education levels that are moved differently by the two interventions. \n\nAfter doing the further reading, I am convinced that both Stronger Minds and Give Directly are effective charities and I will continue to donate to both of them. The two charities have slightly different problems they are approaching with different techniques. I think there is some weak evidence that Stronger Minds might be more cost effective if our main goal is treating depression. There are lots of open questions though, about how effective both charities are and why there is so much variation in their effectiveness. \n\n","\nJust as my own biases led me to immediately believe HLI\u2019s findings, when doing any type of work we are susceptible to our biases. Our biases make it more likely we do work that is misguided or not completely accurate. To wrap up this piece, I am going to examine how some biases might led to faulty work. I also believe that some of the structures around academic research magnify these biases making it more likely that incorrect findings are shared. Taken together, we actually should expect that a non trivial amount of academic research will be incorrect or misleading.\n\nWhen sharing work, there is always the difficulty of making it understandable to an external audience. A researcher will always be the person closest to their work. To share that work with others it is necessary to summarize by focusing attention. There will generally be an incentive to communicate findings strongly and over confidently. As we saw with HLI their headline communication of 12x more cost effective does not feel representative of all the details and nuances of the work. Looking at the the details, the actual story is one of variance and uncertainty. This incentive to over communicate results is both internal and external. Internally, We want our work to be meaningful and to have an impact. Work that does not have a finding feels less important. Externally, others often have an influence on what we are working on.  If a certain direction is not showing promise, then resources might be allocated away from it towards something else. \n\nThis pressure to sum up findings in one digestible and meaningful takeaway, might be one reason that significance testing is such a popular paradigm. Significance testing provides a singular value that determines whether or not we have made a finding. Significance tests are known to be quite arbitrary. Through changing our specification or cutting the data in selective ways it is possible to find a significant result. Significance values also give a false sense of precision in results. Results are often reported to two decimals when our actually precision is much less than that. When looking at HLI\u2019s results, using significance testing implies there is a really meaningful result. But when I looked at the core graphs, the actually story of variation and uncertainty became clear. The use of statistical significance to summarize research results feels more harmful than the benefit it gives of easier communication. \n\nThese biases \/ pressures are not unique to academic research, they are present in all work, but academic research has some structures which I believe magnify these biases. The success of a researcher is measured by their ability to publish in selective venues. The final product of research is considered the publication of the paper. Any work that does not contribute to the publication of a paper is not considered valuable. This further incentives researcher\u2019s to make sure they have made meaningful findings. Furthermore, after the paper is published the work is considered complete. There is not as much incentive to solidify the work or build upon it. Occasionally replications of work are done, but these are not considered to be that valuable of work. \n\nThe decentralized nature of academic research and its reliance on peer review means that work is not as thoroughly scrutinized as it could be. The main way researchers get feedback on their work is through peer review when they are submitting their work. Researchers actually have some incentive to keep their work secretive so that another researcher does not publish something similar before them. This means by the time they are getting feedback, their work is near completion. Only getting feedback once it is nearly finished  limits the types of  feedback that can be given. Furthermore, since peer reviewers make the publication decision, the paper is structured to convince them of the merit of the work rather than about getting good feedback. \n\nEven with these structures, I believe that a lot of really good and meaningful work is done through academic research. There are opportunities for improvement though that could mitigate some of the impacts that biases have on results. \n\n***\nFor myself, recognizing how much my biases and incentives impact me has been really important in improving the quality of my work. There are a couple of lessons I have learned which I trying to bring with me in the work that I do\n1. With every piece of work, I am going to be biased to find a certain result. It is important I recognize which result I find desirable and challenge myself if I end up finding that result.\n2. I use graphs as much as possible and try to look at the same result in a few different ways or with a few different methods. For me to feel quite confident in a result I want it to show up in many different places and also for it be quite large.\n3. In my communication, I try to accurately convey how confident I feel about something. \n4. The best thing I can do to overcome my biases is to put my work in front of others and get their views. Others will have different biases then me and generally they do not have an incentive to have a finding. Their name is not attached to the work. I try to do this early and often and do it with many different people.\n5. Work is never actually complete. It should be followed up on and used. It must be continued to be built upon and constantly reevaluated. It is a recurring cycle. \n\n"],"filename":"research_bias"},{"created":1688544377597,"modified":1688544540450,"title":"New Research Organizations","status":"Finished","tags":["organization_structure"],"blocks":["The role of Incentives","Measuring Success","Success in Academia","Success in Industry"],"blocks_text":["\nIncentives impact ([A Different Funding Model](\/a_different_funding_model)) how we spend our time. In the work world, incentives are often what determines which projects we work on. The simplest incentive to understand is a financial one. I will spend my time working on a project because someone else is paying me to do so. In exchange for money, I am giving someone else my time and energy. I am willing to make that exchange because I believe the money will improve other aspects of my life or allow me to accomplish other things I care about. These incentives facilitate the coordination of many people\u2019s energy into common directions. By paying many employees, a company directs lots of energy towards one goal.\n\nWhile financial incentives are probably the easiest to understand, there are also incentives that are not tied to money. Financial incentives are most powerful when people need money to meet their basic needs. As an individual\u2019s wealth increases though, financial incentives become less effective. When considering different high paying jobs, people often take into account other factors besides money. They will care about the mission of the organization  or the role they are being offered. I have friends who are attracted to working at big tech companies, because of the prestige that comes with doing so. They are less interested in the money, but rather the status of working at a certain organization. To understand why people allocate their energy towards certain projects it is important to recognize the impact of these other non-financial incentives.\n\nThrough studying incentives we can better understand why individuals allocate their energy in certain ways.\n","\nRecently, there has been growing[ criticism](~https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/11\/diminishing-returns-science\/575665\/~) that basic scientific research is not producing output in the way that it could be. If we accept this claim, then there must be something wrong with the incentive structure in scientific research. The incentive structure is what causes people to spend their energy in suboptimal ways.[ Different organizations](~https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2022\/01\/scientific-funding-is-broken-can-silicon-valley-fix-it\/621295\/~) have started trying to tackle this problem by[ changing incentives](~https:\/\/future.a16z.com\/what-is-decentralized-science-aka-desci\/~) in different ways. See Nadia Eghbal\u2019s piece [here](~https:\/\/nadia.xyz\/science-funding#summary~) for an extensive coverage of this.\n\nFrom my own experience with both academic research and startups, I am thrilled that people are trying to create new organizations. My belief that these organizations have problems is from my experience with their incentive structures and the impact it has on me and my peers. Having new organizations with different incentive structures should create new projects that otherwise would not exist. Each of these new organizations has a slightly different approach which stems from their differing thoughts on how current structures are not adequate. I am going to as succinctly as possible state my beliefs about why current organizations have perverse incentives. (I am only going to comment on academic research and startups \/ corporations. These are the two types of organizations I have the most exposure to. I am sure there are difficulties with governmental organizations or non-profits but I have less experience dealing with those so will not speak to them)\n\nAcross organizations, the core problems stem from how success is measured.\n","\n\nIn academic research, success is measured by paper publication in top journals or conferences. Using these third party organizations (journals \/ conferences) to measure research quality could be due to the decentralized nature of academic research. Research occurs at hundreds of universities all across the world. Journals provide one location for research produced at all these different institutions to be evaluated and compared.\n\nAcceptance into a journal is determined through a peer review process. Submissions are generally reviewed by three reviewers who have expertise in the field. Each reviewer gives a numerical grade evaluating the submission.\n\nWhile I can understand why this system has developed, I believe it creates the following harmful incentives:\n\n1. Since reviewing papers is not an activity that impacts a researcher\u2019s career there is minimal incentive to spend lots of time reviewing papers. Generally, researchers are not paid to do reviews. Reviews are additional tasks on top of everything else and sit at the bottom of their priority list. Additionally, there is no tracking or evaluation of if someone is good at reviewing. If reviewers are not putting that much energy into the process, they will probably tend towards promoting work that comes from people who are already successful or institutions that are known to be successful.\n\n2. The easiest path to create research that will get accepted into a top journal is to pick a narrowly defined topic in an already defined direction. Working on narrowly scoped projects makes it easier to publish more frequently. Reviewers are more likely to quickly grasp projects that build upon work they are already familiar with. This disincentives work on projects that are more exploratory or might take a longer time frame. Researchers feel like they do not have these options when they are expected to be publishing in top journals every year.\n\n3. I personally believe that there is still a lot of work that needs to happen after a research paper before the work becomes truly impactful. Research often has to be translated into a form that non academics can understand. There is also work related to understanding the implications and use cases of research. Treating research papers as a final product leaves a lot of work for others to do, before the research can reach its potential impact.\n\nI believe that these incentives lead academic researchers to have much less of an impact than they could. To increase the impact of academic researchers, we need to change how success is measured in the field. Being successful should incorporate being a good reviewer, taking riskier research approaches and continuing to push work forward even after it has been published.\n","\n\nFor companies the marker of success is their monetary valuation. This is true for both public companies and private companies \/ start ups. In public markets valuation is determined by the stock market.  For private companies valuation is determined by VC funds and other funding institutions.\n\nWhile a company\u2019s valuation is connected to it\u2019s revenue and it\u2019s revenue is connected to the value it creates, this system creates the following harmful incentives:\n\n1. Companies are pushed to focus their energy on doing things that will increase their valuation. This often means focusing on growing as large as possible.\n\n2. People are attracted to work at companies that have higher valuations. Since people are attracted to companies that are already successful a lot of talent goes to work at entrenched companies.\n\n3. If a measure of success in our world is one of monetary value then it becomes easy to measure our success by monetary value in other situations. I believe this focus on monetary value leads individuals to benchmark their own success based on salary.\n\n4. It is possible for a company to be seen as successful even if it is not creating beneficial value to society. If a company has figured out a way to make profit, then it will be considered a success.\n\nI believe that these incentives led corporations to have a much less beneficial impact on society then they could. Rather than trying to improve society and understand how they are improving society, corporations are focused on growing their profit.\n\n***\nOur measures of success have such a large influence because we use these measures to help make decisions. When faced with two decisions, we make the one that will increase our success. In the United States, we constantly are messaged that being successful is desirable. We are taught growing up that we should pursue achievement; we want good grades and to attend a good college. It is so ingrained in our society that success is desirable.\n\nUsing success to measure ourselves creates good outcomes when our measures correlate with both societal and individual well being. But if our measurement is not aligned then people may try to hit the success benchmarks at the expense of well being.\n\nWhile I am excited about these new organizations that are being created, I worry that they are not attacking the fundamental problem of changing how we measure success. In general, these new organizations are targeting people who are already in the field of scientific research and attempting to give them more funding. It is possible that by divorcing their funding from traditional outlets they are changing what success means. If that is the case then some of these organizations might create a large shift. But if they are perpetuating our current measures of success then I worry they will not fix some of the current problems.\n\nTo create better outcomes we need new definitions of success. It is important that these definitions are mainstream and speak to a broad audience. Organizations are powerful because it is difficult to work on your own. By creating mainstream organizations which define success differently we can hopefully redirect energy towards increasing societal well being. Rather than college graduates going to work in [management consulting or banking](~https:\/\/judahgnewman.com\/#\/post\/diversity_in_funding_models~) they might work on projects that have a larger positive impact on society.\n\n***\nMy criticisms of existing organizations have mostly centered on identifying problems with what organization\u2019s are producing. But a lot of my thinking about organizational failure actually stems from the unhappiness I see in my peers. So many of the people I talk to are frustrated or unfulfilled by their work life. Since work eats up so much of our time these difficulties quite drastically impact people\u2019s overall well being. I think one of the most powerful ways we can improve individual well being is improving work situations. I know personally that changing my work situations has had a large impact on my happiness.\n\nI believe that people can contribute the most to society when they are happy and content. When people are angry or upset that impacts how they interact with others. It is difficult to contribute your time and energy when you have low levels of well being. If our work organizations are not providing people with fulfillment and meaning, then they are failures regardless of the output they are creating.\n\nThe necessity for new organizations is not only because of suboptimal output. We also need new organizations because currently many are unfilled by their work life. In actuality, these two observations are not independent. One way to improve someone\u2019s work life is to change what output they are incentivized to create.\n\n"],"filename":"new_research_organizations"}]
